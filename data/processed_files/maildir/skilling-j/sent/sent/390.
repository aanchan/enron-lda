Jeff, Thanks for getting back to me.  You probably saved us quite a bit of time and  money.   It looks like half of the City of London has been duped into helping E.ON  fool its shareholders.  I wonder how many of their other sales were actually  auctions versus pre-arranged sales dressed up for the shareholders. We will start our brainstorming sessions over again with a new rule - no  Germans! Thanks again, Joe
