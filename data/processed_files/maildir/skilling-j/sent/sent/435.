Thanks for the update, Andrew.  Just let us know if what the ultimate outcome  is.  SRS Andrew Miles Hi Sherri! I actually sent Gary an email this morning, thanking him for the idea.  I  don't think it is something we would want to pursue at this point - though it  isn't a bad idea. Hope all is well with you. Andrew Jeff Skilling Hamd, would you take the lead on this and keep Jeff posted?  Thanks, SRS Gary Dreadin Hello I didnt know which one of you to send this to so if you cant use it  please disregard.
