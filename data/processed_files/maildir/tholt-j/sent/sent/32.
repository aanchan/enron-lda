Elizabeth L Hernandez Are you in agreement with the demand fee PG&E is charging us.  See e mail  below from Client Services.     	 	 	 Tenaska is billing us for demand fees on PG&E because we didn't take all the  gas that we were suppose to.  The amount is $50,382.00.  They have sent me a  spreadsheet.  If you need me to fax it, please let me know.   Can you also retouch the deal?  The $1 differential is not being calculated  into the price. Thanks, Shielah
