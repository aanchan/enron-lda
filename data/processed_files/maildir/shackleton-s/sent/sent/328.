I will coordinate with your schedules.  How about 3pm BA/SP time?  If not,  just propose a time and I'll be there.  SS The afternoon is better for me.  Sometime after 1p.m. BA and SP time. Andrea Bertone cc: Sorry, guys, I had a bad week. Would you be available for a conference call  on Wednesday (Sept. 8) at any time after 10:00 a.m. BA and SP time (8 a.m.  Houston)? Monday and Tuesday are holidays here. Please let me know.
