Here's what happened to the Enron South America LLC master.  You can now  officially bug Robert George (legal in Sao Paulo) and  Bruce Harris  (commercial in Houston) and remove Andrea Bertone from any official  distribution.  Sara Sara; FYI. Rgds, Sami     	Enron International 	 	 Item 21 is actually a contract being reviewed by Bruce Harris and I.  I have  already discussed the contract with Bruce, but last time I heard from him on  the contract he had some questions for tax.  In any event, it is probably  appropriate to take Andrea off of the list as the "commercial contract" and  put Bruce Harris on instead.   That way people in Houston can start bothering  the right person (ie, Bruce) when they wonder where it stands. Andrea Bertone Sami Arap Andrea & Nancy; Please see item 21 of the attached distribution list. Thanks, Sami All, Sara Shackleton has asked that you all be included on our monthly  distribution of the captioned Schedule.  This Schedule is distributed via  e:mail on the first of every month and sets forth the status of financial  master agreements in Argentina and Brazil.
