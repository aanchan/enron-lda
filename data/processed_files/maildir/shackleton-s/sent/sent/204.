have we ever agreed to this (charge interest for different Payment Dates)   for early payments (i.e., earlier than our usual 5 days after the Floating  Price is determinable)?  SS Melba Lozano 	 Sara, Attached is a draft of the language that needs to be placed in all Michael  Petroleum deals.  Janelle agreed with the counterparty that they will settle  on the last day of the calendar month instead of our usual 5th Business Day.   She is charging 6.5 % annual interest on payments they make to us for the  days beyond the 5th Business Day. (5th B.D.)       6.5% interest   .............................................................................. ....    (last B.D.) Please let me know as soon as you can if this is ok. to put in the  confirmations.  Call me if you need me to go up there. THANK YOU SOOO MUCH! Melba
