Melissa: I just got this but have not reviewed.  Last night we only discussed the  collar.  You could look at their regular swap and compare it to the January  swap (for form).  I have meetings this afternnoon but will get back to you as  soon as I can. Thanks for the spark spread draft which I will also review.

Note that with regard to the collar, the Notional Quantity was not put in the chart of the call and put prices as we discussed, as it was too cumbersome to do so.  It was set out as a separate line item.  We also provided for copies of certain notices to be sent notices to be sent to the Con Edison General Counsel. The draft confirms for the participating swap and the swap also use similar provisions for Notional Quantity and provide for copies of such notices to be sent to the Con Edison General Counsel. Thank you and have a great day! Michael
