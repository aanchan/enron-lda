I don't know a thing about this deal!  I am expecting Marcus to call me this  morning for further explanation.  Forgive my ignorance, but what is a CACS?   Thanks.  Sara 	Treasa Kirby 		  Sara, Do we need to complete a CACS form for this deal and if so does it need to be  signed off by London or Houston as ENA are executing the deal ? Regards At the request of Graeme Francis in our London office, attached please find a copy of the ISDA Master Agreement b/w Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. (I believe this is now Enron North America??) and Toronto Dominion (Texas), Inc. Regards, Dan Carr (416) 983-9473 (See attached file: Enron.doc)  - Enron.doc
