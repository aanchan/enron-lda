I don't think Marie handled yet.  Please handle and advise Brent that you are  the person working on Argentina.  Also, we can send the latest deal report  which we should discuss briefly (and the new list of addressees).  Thanks.   Sara Marie; Could you please email me the most recent form of ISDA Schedule (modified for  Argentina) with Attachments that we could use as a sample document to hand to  prospective counterparts here in Argentina.  We were sent one prior to the  reorganisation and name change.  Thanks.  Please call if you need additional  information.  Brent
