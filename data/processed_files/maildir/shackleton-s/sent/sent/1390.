	Susan Bailey 		  Sara, review and comment. Advise if I may of assistance.   Susan  		  Susan, Per our phone discussion, please forward the attached agreement (in two files) to Sara Shackleton.  As I've previously discussed with Sara, the executables have been routed upstairs for signature by our executives.  I will mail them to you as soon as they are signed.  In the meantime, the attached files are intended to give you all a jump on your review.  Please call if you have any questions.  I can be reached at 425 462-3688, or on my pager at 888 731-9937.
