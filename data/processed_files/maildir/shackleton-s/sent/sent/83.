You should contact ECT's counterparties periodically throughout the  negotiation process, as warranted.  Please call NYSEG to follow up.  Also,  Carol is reviewing the PSE&G comparison so please call her and you guys can  review the ISDA together.  If you are uncertain as to how to keep in touch  with our counterparties, please chat with me.  Thanks.  SS Susan Flynn  Sara -- do you know the status on NYSEG  and PSE&G?       	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 How is the IDSA negotiations going with these guys.  And while I'm at it -  have you heard anything from PSE&G?? Marce
