Tracy Ross at RBC (I spoke with her this morning).  SS 	Greg Johnston 		  Sara/Tana, will you guys be preparing the amended confirms to include the  language?  Once they are prepared, if you e-mail them to me, I will get them  executed and sent to Tracy for execution by RBC. Thanks Greg As discussed, the RBC/Enron swap confirmation needs to be amended so that the  Pricing Dates are subject to the Preceding Business Day Convention.? As the  original commodity swap confirmation was prepared by Enron therefore, can you  please send out an amended confirmation which deletes Floating Price and  Pricing Date(s) in its entirety and replaces it with the attached.? The  amended confirmation should be sent to Ruth-Ann Marchis for signature.? Her  fax number is 416-842-4314. Please call me with and questions or comments.   <<amend.doc  Tracy Ross, Counsel, Royal Bank of Canada Phone: 416-974-5503; Fax: 416-974-2217 File - SW Enron  This email may be privileged and confidential.?
