There are no outstanding issues as to the Tiger guaranty.  We need to have it  executed.  Although we have not seen a redraft from the Tiger lawyers, Per  seems to think that he'll be ablt to transact this week.  Thanks.  Sara Susan Bailey Sara, I never received any word beyond your e:mail concerning the Tiger Guaranty. Therefore, the Guaranty has not been sent to Clement for signature. I will be happy to help when called upon. Sara Shackleton On Friday, did you send the Tiger guaranty to Clem for execution?  SS
