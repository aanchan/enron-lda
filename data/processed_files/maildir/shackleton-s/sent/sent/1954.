Melissa:  Did you ever send this to David per my email? 	Sara Shackleton 		  Melissa:  Would you please sent David an example of a confirm with the GTC's  (standard Annex A).  Please cc me.  Thanks.  Sara 	David Portz 		  Sara:  When you have a chance, would you forward me a sample confirmation for  one of the above referenced trades?   I want to have a sense of the terms of  the GTCs attached to such confirmations when an ISDA master is not in place  with a counterparty.  Thanks.  --David
