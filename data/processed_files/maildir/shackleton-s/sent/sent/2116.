Sara 	Sara Shackleton 		  Please review the blackline.  London is screaming about  this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'll try to schedule a conference call for Monday.   Sara 	Madhur Dayal 		  Sara, Do you know where we stand on an ISDA agreement with JP morgan.  We need one  for Enron North America.     	 	 	     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	   21/09/2000 21:11 	 Nicholas: Henry Steuart asked me to forward to your attention the revised draft ISDA Schedule which I previously sent to Ms. Flynn. As I mentioned in my last note  to Ms. Flynn, the attached draft incorporates all of Morgan's comments and should be self-explanatory. The motivation behind many of our comments was a  conscious effort to keep the credit terms nearly identical to those already agreed to  with other Enron entities. Please review the attached and feel free to call, fax or e-mail me with any questions or comments. Sincerely yours, Mike Stolfi 212-648-8231 212-648-5125 fax (See attached file: Enron North America - MAS#3.doc)(See attached file: Enron North America - MAS#3(blined).doc)  - Enron North America - MAS#3.doc  - Enron North America - MAS#3(blined).doc
