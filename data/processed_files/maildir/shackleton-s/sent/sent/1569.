Susan:  will you please handle. Thanks.  Sara 	Michael Khajeh-Noori 		 Any progress with this? Thanks Michael Michael Khajeh-Noori We have just completed a nightmare negotiation involving a confirmation with  this counterparty and propose entering into an English law ISDA Master with  them to avoid future problems.  I understand that one is already in existence  between this c/p and ECT.  I suggest that we could mirror this and send it to  the cp as a starter.  If you think that this would be appropriate please  could you send me a copy of the Duke/ECT Schedule, CSA and any guaranties. Have a great weekend. Many thanks Michael
