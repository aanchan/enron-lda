That will be fine (for the sole purpose of negotiating the ISDA).  Regards.   Sara Sara:  I am out of town, but receive thed enclosed response from Carol on  this Western contract.  I assume that you are ok with LeBoeuf doing the work  on this for Western.  If not, just let me know.  If it is ok with you, I will  put together a very brief conflict waiver letter like we have done in the  past.  Because I will be out of town the rest of this week, I might not be  able to get it to you till the first part of next week, unless I can free  up.  Let me know if that is any problem.  I hope all is well.

Could you please contact her at 853-5620?  I will be on vacation this week starting on Wednesday and given your   schedule it might make sense to work this with Sara.  Thanks. Carol
