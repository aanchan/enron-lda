Can Brent handle this himself? I believe that I am still authorized to have access to the database.  I think  the problem is that I am on an EI server that is not connected to the ECT  server where the database resides.  Thanks.   Joya - Please submit a security request for Brendt Hendry in Argentina to  have access to the NEW Master Swap Agreements database in Lotus Notes. Thanks, Kaye
