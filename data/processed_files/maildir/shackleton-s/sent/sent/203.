ASAP - what's going on?  SS Any news? Pls fax me a copy of the confirmation once you send it to C.Puerto. Tks Julian Importance:  High I spoke with Dale Neuner (confirm desk) a few minutes ago.  It seems that  Scott Neal sent the deal ticket to EI and not ECT. We have retrieved the  ticket and Dale is talking to Scott about having the deal entered into trade  capture.  Dale is in touch with Brent and will advise when deal has been  entered.  SS SWAP Sara, Was the confirmation sent to C. Puerto? Julian
