Carol:  FYI - this is a Top Ten.  There are no entries in Lotus Notes since  5/5/00.  Hope you had a nice weekend.  Sara 		  At the request of the CP, we would like to redraft the ISDA with the  suggested tiered threshold structure (see attached credit worksheet).  Other  credit terms (ie. guaranties) may need to be amended as described in the  worksheet attached.  We will simultaneously be amending our exiting Master  Power Purchase and Sale Agreement with a similar tiered threshold structure.   If you should have any comments or questions, please contact me at x5-7712.    Regards, Ed Sacks
