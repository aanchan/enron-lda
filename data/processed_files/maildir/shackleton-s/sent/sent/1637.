Please advise.  Sara 		  Sara, Susan: The attached revision of the Appendix to the HS Resources to HS Energy  Services assignment corrects the Total MMBtu column, which had a math error.   The trade descriptions, which would control in any event, have not changed. We would like to proceed with execution on Thursday.   Would you please  accept the changes  in the red-lined documents I sent yesterday, print  cleans, get signatures, and fax to me at 303-296-9709?  I will send the HS  signiture pages in the morning, and will send the J. Aron pages as soon as I  get them. I will be in touch with you in the morning to discuss further. Thanks.
