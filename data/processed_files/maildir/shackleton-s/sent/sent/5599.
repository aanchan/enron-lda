Laurel: Cheryl Nelson is handling this and she will be back in the office on Monday.   By copy of this message, I ask that she contact you.  I believe that this is  nearing completion.

John Greene Julie/Laurel, I am back in London to continue our effort to get equity trading going over  here.  Being back in the States the past two months, however, I have not been  pushing the install of these apps.  I think we are OK on Autex and Instinet  (although there may be issues with their Win2K compliancy) but do not know  the status on ITG/Posit.  Although there may well have been further  correspondence subsequent to the e-mails below, this is the most recent I can  find.  Do either of you either know of any further developments and/or have  the install/contractual package I mentioned?   Thanks and regards, John Julie Pechersky 30/10/2000 14:59 John, I was out on Friday and just read this message.  Let  me know what I can do  to help. Julie John Greene Julie, Do you have any recollection of receiving any software for this install?   Laurel does not have anything on it.  Please let me know as soon as possible  because if we don't have it we will have to get in touch with the vendor to  get it going. Thanks and regards, John John Greene 26/10/2000 16:58 Julie/Laurel, After the flurry of e-mails below, I received a package from ITG/Posit Europe  which I subsequently sent to one of you in Houston.  I am not sure who I sent  it to but I am quite sure it got there and was "put through the channels"  because Sara Shackleton has been working with ITG on the contractual issues.   I am now trying to find out if any software was included in that package  because I would like to get the install process going pending the  finalization of the contract negotiations.  Please confirm as to whether or  not either of you are aware of this installation software. Thanks and regards, John 20/10/2000 08:14 Cyrus Kazak Cyrus Kazak Cyrus Kazak 20/10/2000 08:14 20/10/2000 08:14 John, The contracts for the AutEx system have arrived and are being processed. Do you still require the Instinet and ITG systems I vaguely remember some  contracts being sent through do you know the status ? Thanks Cyrus x35368 John Greene 08/09/2000 10:25 Cyrus/Julie, Can you please coordinate with Jamie White at ITG on this install.  I don't  really care how I get it.  I would presume that someone in our IT group  worked with ITG to determine the best delivery method on the original  install.  If so, please use the same architecture.  If not, please consider  the options and if we think there exists a better method than the one being  in Houston, let's upgrade the one in Houston concurrently with the London  install so the two sites are in synch. This install will initially be for European equity trading only but we may  want to incorporate US equities at a later date as well.  Any activity on  this setup will be governed by the same agreements currently in place as it  will be done on behalf of both ECT Investments and Enron North America until  further notice. Thanks and regards, John      	Enron Europe 	 	 John Is this for European or US equities or both ? Do you want to trade using Internet access or would you prefer a fixed link  leased line ? If you could let me know Thanks Cyrus John Greene 06/09/2000 16:31 Cyrus, Can you please arrange for this installation on my desktop.  Please  coordinate with Julie Pechersky and Jamie White to ensure that my setup has  the same functionality as Selena Gonzales in Houston. Thanks and regards, John x3-5534     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 Hi John, (670-4200 in London) to schedule an installation of the ITG Europe Platform. Good luck getting the office set up! Regards, Kathy 617-692-6500
