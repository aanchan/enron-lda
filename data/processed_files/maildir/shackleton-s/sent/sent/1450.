 Jarrod:  Please let me know when you have received the deemed ISDA doc.  SS 	Jarrod Cyprow 		  I have attached a deal ticket for a transaction done today. This deal was  done with a Swedish counterparty. I assume we need a deemed ISDA. I told them  not to expect the Confirmation until sometime on Wednesday. Please call me if  you have any questions.
