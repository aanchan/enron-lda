Susan:  I need to see if we ever incorporated any P&G comments into any prior  draft.  Then we should redraft a new master (but let's speak with Ed first).   Thanks.  Sara 	Ed Quinn 		  Sara, I think the sleeping giant is awakening....Can you e-mail or send me a copy  of the black-lined (latest) version of the P&G Master ISDA??? We'd like to start this process again.  Please include any changes to the  schedule or credit support annex that have been made over the last 12 months. Thanks; please call me if this is a problem or with any questions. Ed Quinn
