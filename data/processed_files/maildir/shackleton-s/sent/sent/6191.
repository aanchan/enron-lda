Brent, can you bring me up to date, please?  Just stop by.  Thanks. P.S.  Also, what's going on with Caroline Abramo and the hedge funds? Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas  77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax) 	Melissa Ann Murphy 		  Hi Sara, see the message below about the Merchant Energy deal.  I believe  this deal has not been completed yet. Thanks, Melissa Mega just called and said they are going to hold off on this deal until later  in the week. I spoke to Brent Hendry who gave me some good information re:  the confirm and said we could just work directly with the Confirms Group to  get the Confirm out if and when the deal is done.   Sorry for the fire  drill.     Thanks C Sara: I received a call from Mega today.  That financial gas/power deal could come  together today.  Attached is the draft confirm you prepared.  Let me know  ASAP if you have any "issues" with closing this deal pursuant to the language  you prepared.  I will contact you immediately if it closes. Thanks! Chris  << File: swapcontract.doc
