What have you decided about Dow going forward?  Please call.  SS     	 	 	 Willie received a call from Mike Billings, the trader at Dow, and he requested that deal #EY0963.1 from 6/15/99 be revised from Dow Hydrocarbons to Dow Chemical. He is currently signing and sending back the other trades that were changed.   Is it okay to change this deal also, and on a "going forward" basis, all trades must be through Dow Hydrocarbons... let me know...thanks...mgg
