yes.  I'll call you  ss Molly LaFuze I'm so sorry to hear that.  I know that Tana and Marie are never at a lack  for words!  I'm up for whatever.  What time were you thinking....noonish? Sara Shackleton FYI - I have a pretty bad case of laryngitis but I still have to eat lunch.   Maybe I can find a "talking person" to join us so you won't be bored.  Sara
