Did anyone work on the Destec transaction?  Sara 	Laurel Adams 		  Sara, An Interest Rate swap was entered into with the above counterparty in October  1997.  This was part of a large structured Coal deal.  (Coal Capital Co.?)  I  believe the confirm was created in Legal.   Is it possible for me to get a  copy of this confirmation?  We are having a real problem getting this  settlement booked each month, so we want to refer to confirm to see what is  said.  I am out next week, but could you ask someone to send a copy to Todd  Warwick?  he is in ENA reporting and is helping me out with this.  Thanks.
