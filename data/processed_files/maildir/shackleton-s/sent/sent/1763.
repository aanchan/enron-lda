The attached confirm is a swap.  There is no need for a rep in the confirm.   If a weather deal is structured as an option, Gordon Heaney (backed by Diane  Anderson) who confirms weather transactions, adds the weather-specific Trade  Option rep into the confirmation.  The desk uses a template for options.  Let  me know if you have any other questions.  Sara 	Tana Jones 		 I thought this was what we were already doing.  Sara, Mark, wasn't that your  understanding? 		 When the Master does not have the weather modification to the Trade Option  Exemption representation then I think we should include it in the confirm. Is  this feasible? 		  Tanya forwarded the attached confirm on to me.  Are we supposed to have that  weather rep also in confirmations when we trade under a master? 	Tanya Rohauer
