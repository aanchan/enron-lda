please print all 	Daniel Diamond 		  Sara, Here is the project work description from FYI-NET.  I would appreciate your  thoughts on this document. Thanks for your help, Dan Dear Dan,  I have attached the updated PWD with the changes that you and I discussed the other day.  I apologize for the wait, I ended up being covered up by an avalanche for the last several days.  I hope that your trip was good. We are excited about how things are turning out with the project.  It looks like the final project is going to be fantastic. Thanks for all of your help.  Call me if you have any questions.
