Robert:  The executed "Representative Agreement" was executed by  both ENA  and Enron Australia; it was sent to David Minns via Federal Express on July  6, 2000.  Let me know if you need anything further.  Sara 		  Hi Sara, I work with David Minns in Enron's Australian office.  Just a quick query -  can you tell me whether the agreement referred to below has been executed by  ENA? Regards, Robert. Hi, Susan.  Just to let you know that I will have the agreements executed by  ENA once you have initialled and returned them to me.  Thanks.  Sara
