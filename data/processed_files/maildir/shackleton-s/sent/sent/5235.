Phil: Happy New Year! And back to old business.  ENA is holding the amendment pending receipt from  you of the attached Exhibit A (describing the collateral).  I had previously  left you a message but I'm sure it was lost in the year-end madness.  Please  forward the attachment so that we have a complete document.  Thanks.  Sara 	Sara Shackleton 		  Phil: I was just checking to see when we would execute the amendment to the  Security Agreement (to permit the rehypothecation of securities).  Please let  me hear from you. Regards, Sara
