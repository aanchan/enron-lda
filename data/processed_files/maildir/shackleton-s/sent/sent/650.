no     	 	 	 Is this something you know anything about?     	Enron Capital Management 	 	 Michael Brown suggested I contact you on this.  I am SFA registered in the  UK.  Can that be transferred to the US as a series 7 broker registration or  something else similar??  I would appreciate your thoughts and help on this. Thanks
