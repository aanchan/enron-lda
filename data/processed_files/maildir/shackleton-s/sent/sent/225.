    	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 We have not received anything yet.  Carol Gravener is my new Duke contact for  this ISDA and I left a message today with her to see exactly when she sent it  out.  She is out of her office until Wednesday so, I may not receive a  response before then. When I spoke to her on July 28th, she said that they were sending the  comments to us so, I assume that we should be seeing them this week, Regards, Pat Sara Shackleton FYI - We have not received anything.  Have you?  ss     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 Duke did not send comments back to us like Julie Dill had advised a couple of  weeks ago.  However, they will be sending these to us tomorrow. Regards, Pat
