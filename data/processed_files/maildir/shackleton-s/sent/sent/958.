FYI I spoke with Bernardo Andrews about this and he has decided to wait until  Friday for Metrogas to give us their financials. I'll have them sent to  Houston as soon as I receive them and let you know. Thanks for your help. Andrea Credit has not received financials.  Can you help out here to get the ball  rolling?  Sara     	 	 	 I still need financials for this company to evaluate and set credit terms for  the master swap.  Let me know if you perhaps have a contact for me. Rod
