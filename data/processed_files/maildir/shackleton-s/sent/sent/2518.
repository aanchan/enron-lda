Tana:  Here's the background info.  Do you want to prepare the ISDA CSA?  We  will also need an amendment to replace the old with the new.  I now need to  reread Tanya's message.  Sara 	Soma Ghosh 		  Sara, With respect to the amendment to the B of A ISDA Credit Support Annexe, the  contact at B of A is James Allred (MD Energy Finance Group & Credit  Products). He will pass the docs onto the relevant lawyer. Tel: 713 651 4830 Fax: 713 651 4841 As you suggested, I have spoken with Tanya re. the Credit Support Annexe, &  she will be sending you a worksheet.  I have left messages with Teresa re. Mahonia docs. I would be grateful if you  would speak with her so that we have consistency in the Chase & Mahonia  contracts. Please give me a call if you need anything else.  Many thanks,  Soma
