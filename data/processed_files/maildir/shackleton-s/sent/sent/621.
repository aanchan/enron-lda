We have rescheduled the meeting with Tozzini for 2 pm (Sao Paulo) which is 10  am in Houston.  Sara "S?o Paulo, November 11, 1999 Dear Sara: 2 pm is ok for us. Kind regards, Marcelo Rodrigues" Could we possibly RESCHEDULE the time for 2 pm (Sao Paulo) time?  There is currently a four (4) hour time difference with Houston and we will need to conference in several people.  Thanks.  Sara
