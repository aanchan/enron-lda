Tanya:  Please see Vitol response below.  Do you generate the credit  worksheet?  How does London credit fit in here?  Another interesting feature  here is the use of the multibranch provision for a trading company (Vitol  isn't a bank, or is it?).  I have never seen this utilized in practice for a  non-bank entity and have resisted the idea for us.  There is very little  written about the application of the multibranch party and I think that is  because it has been understood as applying to banks.  However, would this  master be a "multibranch master" for us as well?  Sara 		  "ENA") and Vitol S.A. ("Vitol") Sara Firstly, thanks for the message. I am indeed the right person for ISDA's in Vitol. I did meet with your credit people in London ( David Hardy and Lee Munden) and we did discuss the idea of replacing the existing agreement. I am at present in our office in Rotterdam, but will be back in Geneva tomorrow. I therefore do not have the existing agreement with me, but I seem to remember that it is just signed with Vitol SA Inc, which is the US branch office of the main trading company in the Vitol Group, Vitol SA, which is a Swiss company registered in Geneva. I would suggest that you send us a proposal for an ISDA agreement with Vitol SA, set up as a multibranch company about to trade out of its Geneva and Houston office, and with Vitol Holding BV (the ultimate parent company of the group) as the credit support provider. I would hope that once we have agreed terms for the basic schedule and credit support annex, we can then easily add other Vitol or Enron companies as appropriate.

I called for you on Friday, you're out, and no one else could help.  I would like to speak with a Vitol lawyer about (1) replacing our existing financial master with an ISDA (to accommodate a broader range of products) and (2) specifically incorporating the relevant ISDA definitions into the recent weather transaction confirmations even though the master is an early master energy price swap agreement.  Please call me at 713 853-5620 with the information so that we can move quickly.  Thank you for your help.  Sara
