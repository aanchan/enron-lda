How would you like to handle?  We could do a Deemed ISDA if you feel  comfortable that the counterparty will sign the ISDA.  How long is the deal?   SS How should we handle this do you think?  Call me when you have a minute.   Thanks. Brent, could we close a Swap with TGS without having the ISDA signed but  then, a few weeks later after we sending the confirmation we sign the ISDA? TGS wants to close a swap with us starting November 1st. The problem is that  their lawyer, Enrique Prini (do you know him??) is going for vacation next  monday for two weeks. I told the guy from TGS that he should have Chris  Dougall taking over while he is outside, but he did not sound convinced.  Maybe you could talk to Chris?? But still, let's wait until they send us  their comments. Rolo
