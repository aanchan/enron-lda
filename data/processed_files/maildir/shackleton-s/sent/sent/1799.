Sheila:  Mike Fowler is involved in this effort.  He tells me that the entity  is "EnronCredit.com Limited".  Is this info correct?  Sara 	Sheila Glover 		  Sara, What entity are these agreements in.  If they are in ECT Investments name, I  think you should do.  If they are in ENA name, London can sign. sheila Justin/Paul:  The Houston contingent of EnronCredit.com Limited has a number  of agreements which they would like to have executed.  All ENA/Enron Corp.  affiliate brokerage/futures agreements are signed by the Enron trading party  TOGETHER WITH Ted Murphy (for control purposes).  I am currently reviewing   about 4-6 of these agreements. How should we handle review of the referenced agreements originating from  Houston?  Shall I continue to review? Do you have trading resoutions/authorized trader lists in place for  EnronCredit.com Limited? I look forward to hearing from you.  Sara
