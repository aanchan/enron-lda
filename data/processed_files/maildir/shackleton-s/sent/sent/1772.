Yes.  Sara P.S.  Can you call me and let me know what products you are looking to trade  online.   		  In addition to the Buy Side Direct agreement noted below, I am looking at  several other online trading sites for corporate bonds.  For assistance in  reviewing related agreements, should I work with you ?    Thanks. Mike x39990 Mike Fowler I recently joined Jeff Kinneman's group and have been asked to participate in  the evaluation of various internet trading platforms.  Is your area reviewing  agreements / legal issues related to the Buy Side Direct site or its parent  Intelligent Markets ?  Could I get an update on the status of this review and  any outstanding issues ? Thanks. Mike  x39990
