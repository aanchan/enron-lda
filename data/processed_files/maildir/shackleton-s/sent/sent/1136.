Who is working on the "Jana Morse agency" agreement?  SS Sheetal Patel Hello everyone, Hope you have had a wonderful week thus far.  I have attached the revised  confirm for ESA LLC, but before a signature is applied, I would like to get  an okay from you.  I spoke to Sara, and she said that we were working on  getting Jana Morse as an approved signer for ESA. Have a great day! Sheetal :)
