Frank:  Please refresh my geriatric mind!  Are you handling this one? Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas  77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax) 		  Sara,   I checked with Frank and he is not handling it.  My paralegal person is  Stephanie Panus, but I believe she is out of the office this week.  The  latest on this master negotiation was that Stephanie was reviewing some  comments from LDPLLC.   She was working on this comments last Wed., and she  said she was trying to get them done that same day.  I have not heard back  from Stephanie.  Currently LDPLLC is trying to get some deals done on EOL  with longer tenors,  and Credit as well as LDPLLC want to get this master  swap signed as soon as possible.  Will you please check who in legal is  reviewing this doc.? Thanks for your help, Nidia x3-4868 Sara, Will you please let me know what is the status of this master swap? Thanks for your help, Nidia x3-4868
