I'm tied up from 1-3. Taffy Milligan  It looks like 1:30 p.m. on TH, 4/20 will work.    Please confirm. Carol St Clair Taffy: Sara and I have some swap legal issues that we would like to discuss with  Mark.  We probably need about 1 hour.  Can you find a time that works for all  3 of us, if possible this week, but if not, as soon as possible next week?   Thanks. Carol
