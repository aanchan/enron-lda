Mary:   per my voice mail.  SS Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas  77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax) 	Tanya Rohauer 		  Your thoughts? Susan Bailey Tanya, With regard to Credit's "initialling-off" on the Confirmation signature  pages, that would be my call.  I know we have done so with some other  structured deals. So my apologies if this was not to be the case.  If you prefer, Brenda can  run off new signature pages (where legal wil "initial-off" only).  The others  can be destroyed. Brenda, Please run-off new pages, and I will get legal to initial-off only. Cordially, Susan S. Bailey Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, Suite 3806A Houston, Texas 77002 Phone: (713) 853-4737 Fax: (713) 646-3490 	Tanya Rohauer 		 Brenda, I am comfortable with the concept of the confirm you sent me; however, why  are we not circulating the actual final confirmation with the signature  pages?  The file you sent me still has a few blanks, etc.  I am not sure why  credit is signing off on the confirm as this is not standard procedure.  Please advise. Thanks, Tanya Brenda L Funk Tanya, Susan Bailey asked that I forward this to you for your review.  I will send  the signature pages for the confirm to you for your initials.  Please let me  know if you have any questions or concerns. Thanks, Brenda Funk (713) 853-6950 (713) 853-9252 (fax) 		  Latest draft of confirm is attached. Danny  - BREN.DOC
