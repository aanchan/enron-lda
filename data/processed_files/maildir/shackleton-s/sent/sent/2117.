Madhur and Aaron:  I am waiting for a response from  credit.   Aaron:  You had me confused because you kept referring to Morgan Stanley who  we are negotiating with on the equity side.  Who negotiated the  Enroncredit.com ISDA? So, this party trades FX and credit? Sara 	Madhur Dayal 		  Sara, Do you know where we stand on an ISDA agreement with JP morgan.  We need one  for Enron North America.     	 	 	     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	   21/09/2000 21:11 	 Nicholas: Henry Steuart asked me to forward to your attention the revised draft ISDA Schedule which I previously sent to Ms. Flynn. As I mentioned in my last note  to Ms. Flynn, the attached draft incorporates all of Morgan's comments and should be self-explanatory. The motivation behind many of our comments was a  conscious effort to keep the credit terms nearly identical to those already agreed to  with other Enron entities. Please review the attached and feel free to call, fax or e-mail me with any questions or comments. Sincerely yours, Mike Stolfi 212-648-8231 212-648-5125 fax (See attached file: Enron North America - MAS#3.doc)(See attached file: Enron North America - MAS#3(blined).doc)  - Enron North America - MAS#3.doc  - Enron North America - MAS#3(blined).doc
