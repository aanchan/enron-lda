FYI new request.  What about our master tax agreement? Greg Johnston Ltd. Sara, I didn't realize that Shari had left the financial swap group.  She  just sent me an e-mail telling me that she thought you were handling the  negotiation of ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada, so I thought I would forward  this message I sent to Tana today for your information. Thanks Greg Greg Johnston Ltd. Tana, I received a request this week from Jannalyn Galloway of Reliant Energy  Services Canada, Ltd. to commence the process of putting an ISDA in place  between Enron Canada Corp. and Reliant Energy Services Canada, Ltd.  We  recently finalized a Master Physical Agreement between these parties and I  was wondering if you could commence the process of obtaining credit approval  to do the ISDA and provide a draft to Jannalyn.  Her fax number is  713-207-9663, her direct line is 713-207-5893 and her e-mail address is as  above. Thanks for you help on this and if you need anything further from me, let me  know. Greg
