Cheryl: Attached are Con Ed's documents.  We need to do an "ISDA comparison" and  prepare a redline to submit to Con Ed.  Sam worked on the original ConEd  draft, the latest dated 1/24/01.  The file should be in the file drawer.  We  can talk about the comparison when we meet.  Thanks.

ConEd wants to get going on an ISDA , in parallel to adjusting as necessary  the long form for the upcoming transaction.  They believe that the ISDA will  not be negotiated in time for when they want to execute, thus the parallel  documents.   Regarding the annex, the uncoming deals could potentially be swaps, collars,  or participating swaps. I think they are quite eager to hear our response. Thanks, Janelle   Janelle,      Attached for Enron's review are Con Edison's form of the ISDA Master  Agreement Schedule, Credit Support Annex, Form of Guarantee, and Letter of  Credit Form.               <<Con Edison - ISDA Schedule 041001 draft.doc  <<Con Edison  - Credit Annex 041001 draft.doc  <<Con Edison Form of Guarantee.doc  <<Con Edison Letter of Credit Form 041001 Draft.doc Thank you and have a great day!
