Frankly, I do not know what it means  to assign a swap from 1 of these vehicles to another vehicle. I think that in  general the schedules to the ISDAs that each of the 2 sets of parties  executed are the same, but what happens in the case of differences? My rather  simplistic approach would be to terminate the existing swaps in Raptor 2 and  execute new swaps at the same time and on the same terms in Raptor 4.  Unless anyone objects, I propose that we proceed along the lines outlined  above, using the Raptor process documentation developed by Lisa and recently  updated by Gordon. We recently [like yesterday] received closing books on Raptor 3 and  distributed those. If Anyone needs documentation on the other 3 structures,  let us know....[Realizing that they are about to change due to the planned  merger of Raptor 1, 2 and 4 into Mega-Raptor -- sounds like a bad Rug-Rats  movie I recently had the misfortune of viewing doesn't it?] Mary: Do you have a form of "approved" assignment for transferring trades into the  Raptor vehicle?
