Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas  77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax) 		  Sara, A question for you: Would it be possible to very quickly amend the existing ISDA to add the name Glencore AG? Brant is unable to approve certain trades until this is done and  I would rather not wait for the guarantee and credit issues to be resolved as  this may take some time. David
