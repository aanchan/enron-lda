fyi 	Susan Flynn 		   Florencia - the resolutions which you sent to me by facsimile yesterday are  not in the format we use to open brokerage accounts.  We always use the same  form to be in compliance with Enron's Risk Management Policy.  I think that  Nancy Muchmore will be preparing the resolutions and sending them to  Argentina.  Susan D.

Next week, I will be in Brazil so maybe I can take this issue of my pending  list. RFR Dear Rafael,  I talked with Susan, and I am faxing her the board resolution to open  brokerage accounts.  Best Regards  Florencia Groppo Florencia, did you and Susan get a chance to talk today? RFR Rafael Rangel Florencia, we are lacking only one thing to finalize this matter.  We will need to modify the corporate resolutions that you prepared.  I have asked Susan Flynn (713-853-0975) to work with you on making the appropriate modifications to the corporate resolutions.  I left a message at your office today and am requesting that you call Susan on Tuesday to make the modifications. Susan, thanks for your help.  Robert, I am proceeding as we discussed. RFR cc: Estimado Rafael,      Necesitar?a saber en que estado se encuentra el tr?mite de la conversi?n de ADR y su dep?sito en la cuenta de Edide.      Muchas gracias      Florencia Groppo
