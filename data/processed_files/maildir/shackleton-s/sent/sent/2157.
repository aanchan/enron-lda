sorry about the attachmet 		 Sara: I'm not sure if maybe another version of the confirmation was inadvertently  attached, but the attached version that I received is unchanged from the  earlier version that was circulated on 9/27. Thanks. Brent Sorry, I missed your names on the original message.  SS 	Sara Shackleton 		  Attached is a revision to the original swap confirmation.  I have tried to  incorporate all of the concepts discussed yesterday.  Please send comments or  call (X35620).  I will be out of town after noon on Thursday for an offsite.   Sara
