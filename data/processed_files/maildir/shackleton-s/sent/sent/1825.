Brent is looking into this issue. 	Tanya Rohauer 		  Any luck with outside counsel on the issue of holding cash in Canada?   Tanya: Have you followed up on our solution of sending cash in respect of our credit requirements? (We are actually thinking that you could withhold a couple of monthly payments to IPP (currently $680,000/month) in respect of JDI's requirement. We would provide a letter approving this.) ........Mark
