Who will be handling P&G this 'go-round?  Sara 	Ed Quinn 		  Sara, I think the sleeping giant is awakening....Can you e-mail or send me a copy  of the black-lined (latest) version of the P&G Master ISDA??? We'd like to start this process again.  Please include any changes to the  schedule or credit support annex that have been made over the last 12 months.
