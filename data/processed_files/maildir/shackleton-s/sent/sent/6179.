Dick: That will be fine.  However, you need to attach the trade confirmation  (marked Exhibit "A") to each of your certificates since that is how each  certificate is drafted. Thus, for the April 12, 2001 transaction, please resend your certificates  with the appropriate attachments as referenced in the certificates.   Please  call if you have any questions. Thanks for ;your assistance.

I know it is a little more hassle, but it works better for us  politically. Dick: I never heard back from you regarding my email of 4/18/01.  I had asked if you would mind revising the forms of certificate which we will attach to each trade confirmation. We would appreciate revisions to the April 12, 2001 certificates.  This will be the format for all future transactions. Please send revisions to Kimberly Hundl.  Her phone number is (713) 853-1647 and fax if (713) 646-2443. Thanks.

If we leave the reference in the certificate, you will always have to label the confirm as Exhibit "A" and resend the completed papers to us.  Please let me know if you are alright with this change.  If so, we ask that you please resend the certificate dated April 12, 2001.  If you do not wish to make the change, please resend the two certificates to which the confirmation labeled Exhibit "A" is attached. Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks.
