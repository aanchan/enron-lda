FYI 	Jay Epstein 		  Sara and Paul, I have received a request for a quote from Inforsa CI, and Chilean company.   They appear to have an excellent balance sheet, but I don't know if we are  set up to trade with Chilean companies.  Paul, the company's information is  available on Bloomberg if you type in INFORSA CI and hit the equity key.  We  are just starting discussions with them, but I wanted to make sure to give  you both advance notice.  Please let me know if there is any additional  information that you need from me. It looks like it will be at least a month before Singapore Press Holdings  will be ready to do business.  I'll keep you informed as our talks progress. Thanks, Jay Bob Crane     	 	 	 PERSONAL INFORMATION Name:    Jorge Figueroa R.
