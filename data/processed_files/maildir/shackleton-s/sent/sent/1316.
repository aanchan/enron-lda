Thanks for the redraft!  I am looking at the agreement now.  Also, I thought  you would be interested in Mark's comment.  I would like to use arbitration  in lieu of jurisdiction.  Please make that change and forward to me.  I will  mark up with comments.  Thanks so much for your help.  Sara Mark Elliott The Enron policy for our English law Master is for arbitration - although I  have to say, for purely financial contracts, I myself always prefer the  Courts. Kind regards Mark   Sara Shackleton 04/05/2000 01:00 Mark:  Thanks so much for your explanation earlier today.  Just one more  question, please:  is arbitration or litigation the preferance under English  law?  How often do you negotiate to the contrary?  Thanks.  Sara
