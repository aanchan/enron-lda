FYI:  Enron South America has requested a new account for CIESA deal.  I'm  also forwarding Bruce's message which requests 2 accounts.  Sara     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 FYI! Nancy: I just spoke to Rick and he confirmed that EPCA is the company that  needs the brokerage account. I also just learned from Kishkill that we would  like to start trading as early as Friday, if possible. We would appreciate if  you could help us speed up the process. Please let me know if you need any  further information. Thanks. Nancy Muchmore Please let me know which company needs to open a brokerage account in  connection with the CIESA transaction.  Once you tell me which company it  should be, we can start the corporate authorization process and I will  coordinate with Marie Heard of ENA concerning other information she'll need  in connection with opening the account. Please bear in mind that it will take some time (I'm not certain exactly how  long--I will find out) to get all of the proper authorizations and other  paper work into place, once you have decided on the company.
