Martin sent this message to London and Michael advised that Sullivan &  Cromwell be retained.  With respect to interest by the CFTC in  the proposed  transaction, would you agree that the same law firm advise on that issue as  well?  Makes sense to me.  Also, what is Energydesk.com LImited?  Sara Martin Rosell Sara, I hope you're doing well.  Please see my note to Paul below.  It feels a bit  like an overkill to turn directly to Sullivan & Cromwell (as suggested by  Micheal) in respect of a USD 1.25 million transaction.  The target consists  of about a dozen employees and its business is to advise local energy  companies on appropriate risk management structures and routines.  My  understanding is that the target never advises on what trading positions its  customers should take.  Could there possibly be an interest for the CFTC in  this worth investigating further?!  I believe the Energydesk.com Limited  people intend to let Japro survive and continue its current operations (as  well as serving Energydes.com's customers in the future).  Please advise! Martin Fiona Lavelle 99-11-04 16:07 Martin Rosell 99-11-09 12:07 Paul,  The above entity is a Swedish limited liability company which Energydesk.com  Limited intends to acquire.  According to the company's Articles, it may  prepare  analyses, give information, and engage in advisory and consulting  activities with respect to risk management, energy and power trading; carry  out strategic and other analyses and advise on strategic and organisation  development; engage in IT based consulting as well as in any other activity  ancillary with any the foregoing.  Principally, the company acts as a risk  management consultant for small and medium seized energy companies in the  Sweden and Finland. Will the acquisition give rise to any SFA concerns?!  Despite the general  extraterritorial application of US securities laws, I'd guess an acquisition  of a minor Swedish-based operation active in the Nordic market by a U.K.  entity would be too remote to cause attraction over there.  I may check it  anyhow, but do you have a feel for the topic? Martin
