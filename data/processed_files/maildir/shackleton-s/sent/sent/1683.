Brent:  this is weather!  Please call Scott.  SS 		  I received a call from Judy Lee at Swiss RE (212-317-5523) regarding the  standard confirmation we use.  She said that their legal department wishes to  omit Section 4 on Representation.  I said I would forward it on to our legal  department for consideration.  Below, I have attached the most recent confirm  we sent them.  Please advise on how I should proceed. Thanks Scott
