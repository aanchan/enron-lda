Hi, Clem!  Please see below message from Sheila Glover.  I believe that in  the past ENE has only issued a guaranty to Paribas, ED&F Mann and Bank One in  connection with ENA's futures/special margin arrangements.  I'll be speaking  with Paul Radous in credit.  Do you see any issues here?  Sara 	William S Bradford 		  Paul, Can you work with Sara on this? Bill     	 	 	 Bill and Sara, We have been talking with Goldman Sachs, one of ECT Investment's prime  brokers,  about ways to reduce our margin requirement and gain greater  leverage.  Goldman suggested that we may want to consider putting an Enron  Guaranttee in place.   We also have a prime broker agreement with Morgan Stanley.  Per the  documentation that I have... I do not see a guarantte with Morgan Stanley. 1) Can you confirm that no guarantee exists with either Goldman or Morgan? 2) Any comments regarding a Goldman guarantee by Enron Corp for ECT  Investments Inc.? Thanks, Sheila
