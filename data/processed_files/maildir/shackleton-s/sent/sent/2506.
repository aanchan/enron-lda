Susan:  Please let me know what happened with this.  Thanks.  Sara 	John Malowney 		 OSM just called requesting we present them with a contract today, any chance  of making this happen ?? Tracy Ngo Wendy, Please run the due diligence on Oregon Steel Mills.  We're looking at  presenting them both a financial and physical gas contract.  Once you've had  a chance to propose some credit terms, let's discuss. Thanks, Tracy John Malowney We met with OSM and have another meeting scheduled for tomorrow to discuss  proposed structures hopefully to be followed by specific pricing.  We're  talking average monthly volumes of 7,300-7,500 MMBTU for approximately 6-8  months at a price around $10/MMBTU.  I'm sending you this as a "reminder", as  if and when we're able to agree upon pricing and a proposed structure we'll  need to "paper" it by weeks end.  At this time we could be going either  physically or financially.  Thanks,  John
