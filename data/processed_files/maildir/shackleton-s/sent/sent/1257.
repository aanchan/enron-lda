I am ready to finalize the letter agreement.  Please verify that Jeff McMahon  will sign for Enron Corp.  Thanks.  Sara Sara, I tried again to get comments from Gareth but had no luck.  Let's go ahead  and print it out and get it signed.  Please be sure to insert Mark S. Muller  as the signee for EES.  His title is Managing Director. David If the letter is alright, I can have it printed formally.  I never heard back  from Gareth with respect to any comments.  Just let me know what you would  like to do.  Sara Sara, One more reminder for you regarding the letter agreement. Thanks, David David Roland Sara, We still need to get this letter agreement done for Hawaii.  Please give me a  call when you have some time to discuss it. David Attached is the revised letter agreement between EES and Enron Corp. Sara and Gareth, We still need to finish this agreement and have it signed.  To my knowledge,  it has not been completed and signed. David     	Enron Energy Services 	 	 Sara, I'm on someone else's computer - I'm having all sorts of e-mail problems  today. The business person on the  EES side to be signing this letter would be Mark  S. Muller.  He is a Managing Director of EES LLC. I don't necessarily have a problem with the description of the back-to-back  obligations, but I'd like to know Gareth's opinion as to whether the language  is too broad. David Attached is a first stab at the agreement.  Please comment.
