	Theresa T Brogan 		  Sara,  A broker account was set up under Friedman, Billings and Ramsey who clear  their transactions through Bear Stears.  This was a special purpose account  set up to facilitate the sale of DevXenergy for Jedi I.  We plan on closing  this account as soon as the trade settles.  If you have any questions, please  give me a call at extension 31439. Thanks, Theresa
