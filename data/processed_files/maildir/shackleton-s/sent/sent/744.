Yes, the deal is currently being negotiated (by Rodney).  I haven't heard any  details.  It was originally planned to close after X-mas but maybe it will  happen in the next few days.  FYI - I'll be out of the office after X-mas  until next year.  SS David P Dupre Is this the most recent copy of the Merrill Lynch confirmation?
