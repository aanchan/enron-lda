Per my voice mail -      	 	 	 Attached is a general confirm outlining the proposed transaction with  Deseret.  I am not sure where the original of this documet came from.    However, I am providing it to you so that you can have the language for the  general terms of the transaction.   Let me know if I may provide any other information.   In talking with Deseret, they felt that they had a much better chance of  pushing a short form ISDA agreement for this trasaction through the general  counsel than they would the long form ISDA.  That said, I think our best  approach is to set up a short form ISDA agreement for Deseret.   As usual,  the sooner the better on putting together the short form ISDA document.   Today if possible.  Please let me know.
