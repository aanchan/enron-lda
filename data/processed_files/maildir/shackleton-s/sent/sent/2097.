Sam:  Please let me know ASAP whether Jason should be marking the Deutsche  docs based on Sheila's message! 	Sheila Glover 		  For clarification. Deutsche Bank is the new Name..  ENA currently has an agreement in place with  BT Alex Brown who has been assumed by Deutsche.  It apprears that only an agreement  with ENA was set up previously.  ECT  Investments should have one,  as well. sheila       	 	 	 Equity Trading is requesting an Executing Broker Agreement be set up for ECT  Investments, Inc. and Enron North America Corp with Deutsche Bank  Securities.  We do not have one currently in place and we have done a  significant amount of business with them in 2000  (included in top 10 for  8/2000 YTD in brokerage commissions). Thanks. Sheila
