FYI 	Janice R Moore 		  afternoon (6/23).  John Llodra (mid-marketer, part of Ed Baughman's group)  would like to be ready to send out our paper if we are selected as the  winning bidder.  Our bid contained two alternatives (physical or financial),  and NEP could pick either one.  We've prepared a physical contract and wanted  to alert you that there may be a need for a financial one -- which I assume  would be in the form of an "Omnibus" agreement (as far as I can tell, we do  not have an ISDA in place w/ NEP).  John will let us know tomorrow either  way, so we'll be in touch.  In the meantime, please let me or John know if  you have any questions.  Thanks for your help.   Regards, Janice EB3861 Assistant General Counsel, Enron North America Corp. 713-853-1794 (Fax:  713-646-4842) 	Tracy Ngo 	21/06/2000 19:24 		  Genia, Attached please find a credit worksheet containing terms for an EEI Master  S&P does not provide a credit rating for senior, unsecured debt, therefore, I  am electing to use the "long-term credit rating" by S&P and senior, unsecured  debt to apply to Moody's.  Please see the cws for the color allocation. I am available should you have any questions, x3-0554. Regards, Tracy
