Susan: Are you the "someone" who will prepare execution copies?  Strange. Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas  77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax) 		  Keith Marlow, our CFO,  has finished his review of the ISDA forms you guys  sent to us. He is not certain we need it, but has no objection to executing  it. We have no changes.  Please have someone prepare execution copies of the  agreement and exhibits and send two sets over to us for signature by EECC.  Thanks. JWVS
