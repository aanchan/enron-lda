Tanya:  another Vitol message 		 ( "ENA") and Vitol S.A. ("Vitol") David  I agree with your proposal but would like to add that in order to determine  the MAC for Vitol Holding BV, in the absence of a Rating from S& P etc, we  need to receive details of existing bank covenants which I believe you were  going to forward to us. We also need to consider the netting issue between the various entities  involved in UK Power / Gas / Oil  Please give me a call if you have any questions Best regards  Lee     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 15:57 	 "ENA") and Vitol S.A. ("Vitol") Sara Firstly, thanks for the message. I am indeed the right person for ISDA's in Vitol. I did meet with your credit people in London ( David Hardy and Lee Munden) and we did discuss the idea of replacing the existing agreement. I am at present in our office in Rotterdam, but will be back in Geneva tomorrow. I therefore do not have the existing agreement with me, but I seem to remember that it is just signed with Vitol SA Inc, which is the US branch office of the main trading company in the Vitol Group, Vitol SA, which is a Swiss company registered in Geneva. I would suggest that you send us a proposal for an ISDA agreement with Vitol SA, set up as a multibranch company about to trade out of its Geneva and Houston office, and with Vitol Holding BV (the ultimate parent company of the group) as the credit support provider. I would hope that once we have agreed terms for the basic schedule and credit support annex, we can then easily add other Vitol or Enron companies as appropriate.

I called for you on Friday, you're out, and no one else could help.  I would like to speak with a Vitol lawyer about (1) replacing our existing financial master with an ISDA (to accommodate a broader range of products) and (2) specifically incorporating the relevant ISDA definitions into the recent weather transaction confirmations even though the master is an early master energy price swap agreement.  Please call me at 713 853-5620 with the information so that we can move quickly.  Thank you for your help.  Sara
