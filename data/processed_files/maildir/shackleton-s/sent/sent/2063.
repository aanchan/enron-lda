Two swaps will be documented under the ECT/Citibank maste  and two under the new Garden State master  (Was Molly in the process of  amending that master?  She never returned my voice mail.).   Rodney and/or  Finley should call you.  Sara 	Tanya Rohauer 		  I assume you mean a master between Garden State and ENA?  Please let me know  where we are in the whole process.  thanks     	 	 	                            	 Garden State is still me.     	 	 	                            	 Tanya,  You have been leading this up to this point.  Do you wish to continue, or did  you need an assist? Paul All:  I met with Rodney Malcolm and Finley Biggerstaff about the two 7-year  paper swaps between each of Garden State/CITI and ENA/CITI.  Who will be  handling credit for the new master and the transactions in general?  I am  told that this is a Q3 deal.  Thanks.  Sara Molly:  I left you a vm about prior efforts to amend the ENA/CITI master.   Weren't ;you speaking wth someone at Citibank?
