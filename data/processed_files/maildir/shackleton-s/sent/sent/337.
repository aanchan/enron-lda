    	 	 	 Spoke with Joe Manogue this morning. He has been speaking to their external  council (S&S) daily trying to get a lined draft of the document with all  changes. He was supposed to get it last Friday, is now promised it this  morning. He plans to review and fax it out to you this afternoon, following  up with a hard copy by Fedex overnight. He's doing all he can to speed the  process along. I'll call you when I hear more from him. Per
