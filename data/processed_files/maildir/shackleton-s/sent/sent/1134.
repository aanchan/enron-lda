Brenda:  This looks fine.  Please have an executed copy sent to the attention  of Susan Flynn (for ENA's files).  Sara Brenda L Funk Sara, Attached you will find the Swap Termination Agreement for your review.   Please let me know if you have any comments. Thanks, Brenda As requested.......Regina       Attached for your review are (i) an execution copy of the Assignment of Membership Interest, (ii) a draft of the Swap Termination Agreement, and (iii) a draft of the Guaranty Termination Agreement.  I told Michelle Vonderhaar that we would e-mail to her copies of the Termination Agreements after you have had a chance to review them.  Please let me know when you would like me to send them to her.  Michelle also indicated that it would probably take a couple of days to locate someone who is able to sign on behalf of Bankers Trust International PLC, which means that we will have to execute those documents as of a date after March 28, 2000.  Please do not hesitate to call should you have any questions. --Paris  <<Swap Guaranty Termination Agreement.DOC  <<Swap Termination Agreement.DOC  <<Assignment of Membership Interest.DOC  - Swap Guaranty Termination Agreement.DOC  - Swap Termination Agreement.DOC  - Assignment of Membership Interest.DOC
