Stewart, effective 1/1/2002, the Warm Springs Tribe will be purchasing a 1/3 share of PGE's Pelton/Round Butte Project.  They will be selling the output to PGE at prices indexed to the Dow Jones Mid-Columbia Index, and are interested in executing financial swaps to manage their market price risk. Would you please forward on to me drafts of the legal documents that will be required to execute financial transactions (e.g., ISDA, legal opinion, etc.).  As with my previous request pertaining to the public utilities we are working with, I ask that Sara Shackleton be assigned to this.  Thanks for your help.  I think we are interested in moving fairly quickly to get the necessary documentation in place. Jeff
