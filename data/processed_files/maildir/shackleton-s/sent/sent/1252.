We need to finalize.  Legal opinion needs to come from Mark Haedicke (my  recollection is that he may not need the back up).  Have we requested the  guaranty?  Thanks.  Sara Sara,      Any progress on getting a guaranty, legal opinion and a corrected certificate of the secretary for me?  I will forward the executed master to you with my attached docs once I receive these docs from you. Thanks Chuck
