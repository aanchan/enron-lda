FYI Lee Munden Jeff I have spoken with Carl and agreed to send him a draft Master gas sales  agreement, together with ISDA documentation based upon the agreement that  Carl says is already in place with ECT Houston. Lee Do you anticipate doing trades with Sempra in the future?  Please see below  which indicates Sempra's desire for a master if that is the case.  Please let  me know. 713-853-5294. Thank you, Jeff Sorenson  Tanya Rohauer I suspect they plan to do deals there as they are trying to get Enron Corp to  guaranty the UK entities.  Talk to Lee Munden (London Credit) as he has been  managing the Sempra relationship over there. Thanks, Tanya Do you anticipate future ECT International deals with Sempra?   Thanks, Jeff Sara Shackleton Credit needs to initiate (and it may have to be London credit) but Tanya  Rohauer will know.  FYI - London told us that Sempra "will not trade with ECT  International."   SS If we anticipate having to document any trades under ECT International Carl  Petersen is going to want a Master set up with that entity.  Who needs to  initiate that? Thanks, Jeff
