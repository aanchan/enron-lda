John:  What's happening here?  Sara 	Jennifer Fraser 		  Sara; Dave's # is 403-262-6400 How are we coming with the ISDA agreement for MP with parental guarantee from  Heritage? Also, does MP need to invoice ENA for May SWAP transactions or do you issue a  credit invoice and wire transfer payment to MP? (Deal #s NA 1279.1 and 1279.2). Regards, Dave  - att1.htm
