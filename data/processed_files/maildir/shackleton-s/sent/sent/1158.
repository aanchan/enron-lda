You'll handle? Susan Flynn  Please review message below and advise.   Thanks!        	 	 	 Susan, Can you forward this to the appropriate legal person: BP Amoco Corporation - still marks up Annex A, Setoff paragraph so that the  word "derivative" is added (see attached - change in red, Section 5) We have  recieved prior approval to "Execute" the EOL deals in which this change is  made, but not the non-EOL deals.  Is this still correct? Aquila Canada Corp. - marks up Annex A as attached (see markups in red)  (All  are EOL deals)
