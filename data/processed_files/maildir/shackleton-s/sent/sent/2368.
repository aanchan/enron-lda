this is from Jason 		  FYI cc: I'm waiting on Clement Abrams response to one comment on the Guaranty. everything else is finalized. cc: Jason, I talked to MidCoast today about their collateral threshold, we have agreed to give them a $2MM threshold, I cannot remember off hand what I gave them originally, but this is the new amount. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks Russell 713-345-7095
