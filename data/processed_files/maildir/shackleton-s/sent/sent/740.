This is the deal that Susan F.  worked on on Friday.  I'll forward the  Schedule to you.  No one is asking for a revised Schedule yet but we should  make the change and email  the parties on Susan's email so that everyone  knows the latest changes and then ask if anyone has comments.  ss Tracy Ngo In follow up to our conversation earlier today, please take out the Threshold  Amount applying to the parties of the ISDA.  This would result in the  Threshold Amount to only be tied to the Credit Support Providers.  This  provision will then be parallel with the physical contract. Regards, Tracy Tracy Ngo Please find the financial credit worksheet for an ISDA Master Swap Agreement  x3-0554 should you have any questions. Regards, Tracy
