Susan:  The docs are in my "in box".  I haven't reviewed and need to speak  with Sheila (or have you already contacted her?).  I don't know the timing  for this transaction.  How long will it take to open the account?  Feel free  to grab the docs.  SS 	Sheila Glover 		  Sara/Susan, Rafael has sent the information to me and Kelly is dropping it off to you now. Sheila Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following: Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de  Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE) This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its  account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357)  at Morgan Stanley. EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into  EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution  that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated  February 20th, 2000. After the ADR's are transferred into EPCA's accounts, EPCA will need to  convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be  registered accordingly in Argentina. Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support  (corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution  authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo  Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign). Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction. Best Regards, RFR Rafael Rangel Sheila, finally ready to open up the account at Morgan Stanley for EDIDE so  that EPCA can transfer the correct amount of ADRs.  I have the Corporate  Resolution from EDIDE.  I understand that the contact at Morgan Stanley has  changed.  Please advise. RFR I will be out on maternity leave soon (hopefully).  In my absence, please  call Sheila Glover (3-3210) for any questions that you may have.  If you just  need a copy of an old report, please call Aneela Charania at 3-0951. Thanks, Terri 3-9899
