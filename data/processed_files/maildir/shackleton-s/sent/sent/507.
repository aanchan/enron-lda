Kaye:  I e-mailed David Portz this morning and he hasn't opened the message.   Can you please (1) find out if he's even in the office today AND (2) just get  a copy of the agreement which Dale is referencing below.  Thanks.  SS Kaye Ellis to Jeff Shankman. The same Agreement has been revewed and executed for the Power group by David  Ports. Dale Kaye Ellis In case any of you have tried to contact Sara, she is not in the office today  (her voice mail message states this).  She has laryngitis.  Her doctor has  asked her not to talk at all.  She is planning to be in the office tomorrow.   If possible, could you try to commuicate through email as much as possible.   She can hardly whisper and I promise you will feel really, really guilty if  you ask her to talk. I'll be happy to deliver any messages to her.  My extension is 3-5968.
