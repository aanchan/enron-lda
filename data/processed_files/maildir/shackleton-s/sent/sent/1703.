Julia:  don't do anything yet as I am putting together the package for this  afternoon.  Sara 		 sorry i did not get a chance to revert back to you earlier.  was out in new  york. ok -- i will work on getting resources to help.   however, could you confirm with everyone that you have NO OTHER deals other  than what jill has listed?  preferably before our meeting this afternoon? many thanks. All:  I am comparing this list to mine but Jill's certainly looks more  comprehensive!  Jill said she may not have signed confirms, etc. but we  should get copies of all live equity deals.  I don't have paralegal  capability for this work at the moment.  Sara Julia:  Could you please call me when you receive this message? 	Jill Erwin
