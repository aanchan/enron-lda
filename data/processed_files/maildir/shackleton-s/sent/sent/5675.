Yes, please.  Let's look at the .com master before we do anything.  The Enron  Corp. master should be "easier". Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas  77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax) 		  FYI - I received a voice mail from Anita Khosla of CSFB (212-538-1938).  She  wants the Enron Corp. master to mirror the master they recently executed with  Enron Credit.com.  I have not had a chance to call her back yet.  Do you want  me to obtain a copy of the Enron Credit master? Stephanie
