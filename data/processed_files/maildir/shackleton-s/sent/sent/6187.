Kristina: I'm sorry too! However, I also sent your application through Houston and it may end up with  a different group.  I'll keep my fingers crossed (not just for Enron) because  I know you'll find an exciting position with a good company. Hope all is well.  I just returned from a week in California and I'm having a  hard time adjusting to the office. Regards.

I thought perhaps ebusiness or the like would have been fun. I'll keep you posted on any future news from them. Kindest Regards, Kristina cc: Dear Michelle: Thank you for your email and phone message. I am presently visiting my parents in New Orleans. I would be available for a phone conversation on Tuesday. The telephone number is +504.283.1652. New Orleans has a 6 hour time difference with London. It is best to reach me in the morning, perhaps Kindest Regards, Kristina    Kristina    Many thanks for your on line application for the Enron Europe's A&A  programme.    I tried to call you  this afternoon and have left you a message on your  answer phone. I would be keen to have a telephone conversation with you  next week and am contacting you to schedule an appropriate time.    It may be easiest if you specify a time that I could contact you. Currently  the most likely availability in my diary is for Tuesday, if this is  convenient for you.
