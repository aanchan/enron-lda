Carol:  Tanya's comments.  Let's go ahead with the "conversion" per Tanya. Sara Shackleton Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a Houston, Texas  77002 713-853-5620 (phone) 713-646-3490 (fax) 		  Sara, Some thoughts on some of these: Entergy Power Marketing - shouldn't be using anymore - Axia is the mktg JV  for Koch and Entergy LG&E - hardly ever see trades here anymore; once in a blue moon we see  something - not worth anyone's time Cross Timbers, Belco, Breitburn, Cabot - all Fred customer's - I would not  hold my breath Dynegy Canada - should already be on our list Dynegy - should convert to an ISDA Reliant - should convert to an ISDA MSCG - should convert to an ISDA The rest can wait for another time. Sara, The attached is a list of Companies with whom we currently have a non-ISDA  master and with whom we still do a good deal of trades with.  They are listed  in priortity order of which ones we would like to see converted to ISDA . Thanks, Joe  << File: ECT Master CP's priority.xls
