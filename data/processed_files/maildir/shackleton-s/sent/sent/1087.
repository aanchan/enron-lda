I am forwarding a resume from an Enron Argentina legal candidate who is  perhaps interested in ENA. Sara; I am forwarding to you a copy of Esteban Buljevich's resume for your review.   We have interviewed Mr. Buljevich for our BA Office, but we would think that  he would rather pursue an opportunity with Enron North America.  I would  greatly appreciate it if you could forward Esteban's cv to the appropriate  people within ECT and ENA. Thanks, Sami Sami: Thank you for your emails this morning.  Attached is a copy of Esteban Buljevich's c.v. as you requested as well as a copy of his list of selected transactions. I am very pleased that you will be speaking to Randy about Pablo de Rosso. Please let me know if John Novak requires my assistance in arranging to speak with Joaquin Sales Saborit. Regards, Stanley Ross  - BULJEVICH Esteban 2/00
