I spoke with Rod Nelson about this party and Rod has been waiting to hear  from you to speak with EDF.  I'm confused by your message as to who is to  participate in your Thursday meeting.  FYI, there is an ENA meeting in  Houston on Thursday afternoon.  SS The people from EDF have confirmed the meeting for Thursday at 5:00 pm. I think it would be good to have Andrea in the meeting as well. Julian Julian, ? Te confirmamos que estaremos en tu oficina, el Dr.  Mart?n Cassone y yo, este  jueves a las 17 horas para hablar del tema del  ISDA. ? Te agradezco por tu ayuda en la constituci?n de  esta reuni?n. ? Atte  Guillaume
