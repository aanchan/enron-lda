Sara has the agreement  as Gary had sent directly to her. I would not have included everyone in the CC regarding this question which  relates more to Logistics between Legal and me. Many Thanks. Sheila Sheila, should this account be placed on the high priority list?  Also, to  whom in legal did you send the info? Cheryl Nelson Senior Counsel EB3875 (713) 345-4693 		  Cassandra, Bill and Cheryl, We have sent to legal a request to open a new Futures Clearing Agreement with  JP Morgan Chase.  Gary is requesting that we establish this account to  provide additional coverage for Rate & Currency  and Equity Products.  Carr  and Pru have lost some key persons and service levels are not deemed to be as  good as previously. Thanks.  Sheila
