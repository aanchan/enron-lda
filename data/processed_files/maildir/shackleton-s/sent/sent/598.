FYI FYI Don Black Although no formal notice has been rec'd from Duke, They have informed me  verbally that they do not intend to proceed with any claims against us.  If  you need any details please call me in BA or send me an email with your  contact instructions.  Given the nature of this topic I would prefer to  discuss my thoughts on the subject in person, if necessary.  Thanks for  everyone's help, and I apologise for any inconvenience.
