We'll have to put a master in place.  SS Sounds like the NDF's will be booked to Enron South America LLC beginning  Novmeber 15, 1999.   Lynn Carolyn Barrett Lynn, From a cash perspective, we are going to start having wires, invoices etc.  paid on behalf of the LLC beginning on November 15 so that we can minimize  the activity on Enron International Inc. (1U9).   Carolyn Barrett Lynn Aven I am getting calls again from people asking me whetehr to book the NDF's in  Enron International or ESA.  As I had mentioned, I am indifferent from a tax  perspective but did not know whether you were ready from an accounting  perspective to switch these transactions to ESA.  Where do we stand on this  issue? Lynn
