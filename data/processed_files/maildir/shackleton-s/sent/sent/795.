Here's the attached termsheet I have forgotten, does the originator need to get credit approval if a master  is in place?  Or does the credit dept. review the positions after the fact? Julian Poole No I haven't spoken to Pat yet. I believe credit analysis has already been  done before the ISDA was signed. Like when we did the swap with Puerto, there was no credit done for that  particular transaction. Julian Brent Hendry Sara, Here are the indicative terms we are looking to get three price quotes for  from CMS.  Julian will need to get you the contact information for the  counterparty.  We would like a letter from ENA requesting the quotes for the  trade information specified below and an attached confirm format with the  price, term and volumes left blank since those terms are not yet set.  Please  let me know if you have any questions or if you need any additional  information.  We would like to have this letter sent in the next few days and  would like to request a response from CMS by the middle or end of next week.   Julian can give you a more exact time frame for a response.   Please send  Julian the draft for review and copy me.  Thanks for your help on this.   Julian, have you spoke with Pat about the potential deal yet?   Brent Julian Poole Brent: pls. have a final look at it before sending it to Sara. Thanks, Julian
