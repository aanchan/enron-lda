Guess what?  Lotus Notes prompted me that there was more than one "Marie  Heard"!  Could this be true or do I have a virus?  SS Sara Shackleton Mark and I met yesterday.  I am NOT making my proposed changes to either  Section 2 or Section 8 of the Omnibus other than adding definitions for   "Option" and "Floor Amount" to Section 8.  This does not interfere with all  of our other general changes to Annex A (which include the comment about  "Total Premium" which should conform to the online version).  So, Annex A is  ready to go!
