fyi     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 We should move forward with this waiver.   From a credit standpoint, I do not  see any issues with releasing the Master to an affiliate. Please note that I will be requesting a guaranty from the parent to cover  Duke Energy International. Regards, Pat Cini Federico Cerisoli cc: Of course I approve it. Brent Hendry cc: Do you approve the waiver? cc: In response to your email, yes, our confidentiality language was so limited  that it did not allow us to provide the agreement to affiliates of either  party without consent.  We revised the form about 9 months ago to broaden the  langage to include affiliates, but Duke is an old master so they need our  consent so they can provide it to their affiliate.  Unless Federico has any  reason not to waive the language, I think we can go ahead & draft a waiver up  here and send it to Duke.  Can you talk to Federico asap and run that by him  and let me know so I can get this over to Duke.  Thanks!
