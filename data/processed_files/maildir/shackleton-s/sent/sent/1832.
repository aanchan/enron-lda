Jason:  Before we designate specific individuals, let's think this through.   A "generic" address may be more appropriate.  Which agreement did we recently  sign with reference to the "Documentation Desk"?  Sara 		 Jason, I suggest that Madhur Dayal be designated initially at the person to  receive notification of material changes to agreements.  We should retain the  ability to change this contact person. Sara, as noted in my earlier email to you and Sheila Glover, we should ensure  that agreements with online trading platforms allow for trading by ENA, ECT  Investments and EnronCredit.com.    Thanks. Mike 713-853-9990 Mike, Who should notices be addressed to? Jason
