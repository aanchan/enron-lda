FYI Mark Evans Sara, You are correct on both fronts. "Enron Power Holdings" is, I believe, an  error.      Mark Sara Shackleton 17/04/2000 15:50 Please ADVISE if "European Power Holdings" is the correct legal entity for  closing out the FX piece of Sutton Bridge and if Maroon Aboudy is the party  to whom a confirm should be directed.  Thanks.  SS Laurel Adams Sara, somehow your name got dropped when I sent this message.  Please let me  know what you think. Laurel Adams Sara et al., As part of the Sutton Bridge unwind, Trena has executed a foreign exchange  deal with the parent company--European Power Holdings.  Is the attached form  of confirmation acceptable to that counterparty?  Also, is Maroon Aboudy the  appropriate person to send the confirm to, or should it be someone else?   Thank you.
