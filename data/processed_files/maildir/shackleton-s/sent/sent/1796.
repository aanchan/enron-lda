Jason:  Two more electronic agreements. Samantha:  Please enter into database. 		 We are considering several online trading platforms for trading investment  grade, high yield and convertible corporate bonds.   The sites we are considering are as follows: Market Axess & LIMITrader - I will send you documents for these sites today. Buy Side Direct, for which documents are being reviewed by your group. Trading Edge / Bond Link - The review of documents for this site was  originally handled by George Weber, who has since forwarded these agreements  to Carmen Ayala. Thanks for your assistance in reviewing these documents.  Please let me know  if I can provide additional information during your review. Mike x39990 Yes.  Sara P.S.  Can you call me and let me know what products you are looking to trade  online.   		  In addition to the Buy Side Direct agreement noted below, I am looking at  several other online trading sites for corporate bonds.  For assistance in  reviewing related agreements, should I work with you ?    Thanks. Mike x39990 Mike Fowler I recently joined Jeff Kinneman's group and have been asked to participate in  the evaluation of various internet trading platforms.  Is your area reviewing  agreements / legal issues related to the Buy Side Direct site or its parent  Intelligent Markets ?  Could I get an update on the status of this review and  any outstanding issues ? Thanks. Mike  x39990
