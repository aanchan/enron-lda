per my voice mail 		  Randy/Sara,   Please confirm if Enron can or cannot execute a financial swap with Aracruz  Brazil. Alternatively, we need input on Enron's ability to execute a financial swap  for pulp with Aracruz's off-shore, Panamanian  subsidiary.  We are trying to prep for a discussion scheduled for tomorrow, Thursday  afternoon, Sao Paulo time (4 hours ahead of Houston).  Thanks your help.
