Scott:  I only have comments from Ryan and Donette.  Mark Spradling left me a  message about five minutes ago and said that he would have comments tomorrow  morning (and to copy Shelley Barber on any drafts).  Once I receive comments,  I'll prepare another draft and circulate.  Sara 	Scott Sefton 		 Sara, Since you're out the rest of the week from noon tomorrow, we'd really  appreciate it if you could prepare a revised confirm tomorrow morning so we  can deliver it to LJM for their review. Then, we can hopefully sign the  confirm on Monday. Thanks! Scott Here are comments from transaction support group on the LDC swap.  I have  marked my changes against a clean version of the latest swap. Regards, Ryan
