I hope that there is no more confusion! The opening of each brokerage account should require two signatures for  control purposes.  ONE of those signature MUST BE either of Ted Murphy or  Rick Buy (their titles frequently change but check the Enron Corp. corporate  workbook).  The SECOND signature MUST BE an officer of the entity opening the  account.  We suggest the level of authority used by ENA but certainly  whatever appears in the entity's unanimous consent or resolution authorizing  the opening of brokerage accounts.  I think that Marie previously sent you a  form.  Let us know if you have any questions.   What is the timing on the Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII Ltd. account? Regards.  Sara I guess I meant Enron South America generally--Enron Brazil Power Holdings  XII Ltd. is one of its companies.  I think you answered my question on a  general basis--thanks very much.  Sorry if I confused you. Also, I need to know if anyone from ENA needs to be appointed in addition to  ESA people.  Robert:  Who at Enron South America should be appointed? Nancy Nancy, I am confused by your e-mail.  I thought the brokerage account was going to  be opened for Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII Ltd., not Enron South America.   We typically require any one of the President, any Managing Director or the  Vice President, Finance and Treasurer, together with any one of the Managing  Director, Legal, Rick Buy or Ted Murphy.  Of course, the level of officers  may vary from entity to entity.  Marie  Marie:  Who are the people you normally appoint to sign, etc., on brokerage  accounts?  Should Enron South America consider using the same people in order  set up this account?  We could then appoint Enron South America people  later.  Thanks.  Nancy Robert H George I spoke with Ted Murphy regarding setting up the brokerage account for the  Copel shares.  He indicated that the easiest thing to do is coordiante with  Sara Shackelton (ECT finance lawyer).  Typically, she sets up the paperwork  and Ted (or Rick) signs off on setting up the account (she has done this many  times).  Robert may have already done this or it may not be necessary in this  case - I will leave that up to him.  Regardless, Ted (or Rick) does need to  be one of the people who sign the documents.  Sorry for the delay. Patrick
