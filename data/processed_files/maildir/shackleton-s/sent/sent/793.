Pat:  Do we need to talk? Sara: The contract was negotiated and signed in Portuguese (actually Enron  still did not sign it). I will prepare an English translation for you. I hear that a binding agreement and/or PPA was signed with MOEMA for a  10-year transaction.  Do you have an English version of the MOU or PPA?   Details?  Thanks.  Sara
