Melissa:  It looks like we'll need GTC's for a yet to be named FP&L  counterparty to do this daily call option (spread).  Credit (Ed Sacks) knows  about this deal.  You may want to think about the format.  Have we done this  before?  Did you work on the Moosehead (Merrill Lynch) deal?  Sara 	Janice R Moore 		  Further to my voicemail, here's the deal that John Llodra is trying to  present today.  As I mentioned, I didn't get any definitive answers this  a.m., but I think this deal has to be documented on an ISDA or ISDA-like   form.  Let me know if I can help.   Regards, Janice EB3861 Assistant General Counsel, Enron North America Corp. 713-853-1794 (Fax:  713-646-4842) 		  All: Attached is a draft of a term sheet for a financial resid-power spread option  with the customer sometime early-mid afternoon on Tuesday 9/26, so I'd  appreciate any comments you all might have.  I will be out of the office in  the morning at a customer meeting, but will be available by cell 978-314-5614  please feel free to go through Joe Gordon at 5-8956; Joe is an Associate  newly assigned to the Northeast mid-market team (Joe will only be around in  Some specific points I'd like to raise: Oil price index/curve -- Pearce Hammond (structuring) and I spoke with Dave  Botchlett (our resid trader) Monday about:  (1) the most appropriate resid  oil index to use; and (2)  the "correct" resid curve consistent with that  index.   Dave did not sufficiently answer these two questions, so I called  Paul Racicot and asked him what he thought.  Paul suggested using the Platts  Daily New York Harbor Resid Cargo Mean index (which i've included in the term  sheet attached), as that was probably the most hedegable index.  Other  alternitives that I am aware of include Platts Daily New York Harbor Barge  Mean and perhaps others.    We have the daily option to "dispatch" the energy  or not, so I think we want to use a daily oil index rather than a first of  the month index, etc.  Paul Broderick - do you have any thoughts on this?   Assuming the Cargo Mean is the right index, we then need to make sure the  resid curve we use is consistent with that index.  Pearce - could you perhaps  connect with Dana/Paul Broderick/Ed Baughman/Joe Gordon to see if we can come  to aggreement on index and appropriate curve. Resid-power coorelation -- Dana - what coorelation do you want to assume;   Pearce, please connect with Dana to confirm that number. Janice/Ed -- if it's not evident, this proposed transaction is with the  unregulated marketing sub of Florida Power & Light, not the regulated  utility.  We have done other trades with this entity so I'm assuming we're  all set with Master Agreement, etc.  Does our basic Master cover financial  structures like the one outlined in the attached? Any comments/feedback you have would be much appreciated.  Thanks Regards John
