I knew you were going to say that!  But, dubba, what KIND of clothes?  Do I  need to bring jewelry? money? stockings?  I mean, what did YOU wear in LA?   What would you like for me to bring you?  nachos?(ha, ha)  The phoebebee says  hi.  Call me later if you're working.  ss I think people dress in clothes.  I saw everybody in everything, it's just that Patina seemed a little bit snootier than the others (the food is fabulous though).  Maybe the Parkway Grill isn't on the list because that's the wrong name of the restaurant.  Maybe it's really Perkway Grillades. Love you lots. Deb  cc:  Hey Sass,  My life is a mess!! I barely have time to pee.  These are the restaurants I remember as great--Patina (but you can't  wear jeans I don't think), La Campanile (maybe it's El Campanile) and  Parkway Grill.  Have fun.  Love,  Deb
