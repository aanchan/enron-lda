Sorry I can't help. Also, you know that legal will be out of the office from Wed. afternoon  through the end of the week.  Are there any pressing items?  Sara Laurel Adams I faxed the final confirmation to Patti Melcher at Echo yesterday.  In order  to get the counterparty set up in Global, I need something on EMP Echo  letterhead.  Does anyone have anything that they could fax to me, that  indicates the full company name, address, and maybe even bank instructions?   ( I know--I'm asking for a lot!)  Thanks very much for your help.
