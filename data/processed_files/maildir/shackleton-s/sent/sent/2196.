Let's redline (or accept) Ryan's changes and redistribute.  Thanks.  Sara 		  Sara, The version you distributed yesterday does not include the comments that I  sent to Scott Sefton last week.  Attached are my revisions.  You can feel  free to distribute to the broader group if you want.  I will get comments  from Rodney Faldyn and Bob Butts and then would like to distribute to LJM for  their review and execution.  Let me know if there are any outstanding  comments and/or issues. Regards, Ryan 		  I am resending this email for the benefit of those of you who did not receive  it on October 5. 	Sara Shackleton Attached is the revised Raptor 2 hedge.
