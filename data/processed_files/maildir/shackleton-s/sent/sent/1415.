FYI - thought you'd find this interesting.  ss 	Kelly H Boots 		 Sara, I am not aware of any such agreement with Bank One.  They are not one of our  top banking relationships, but it is good to see them get some ancillary  business. Thanks, Kelly Kelly:  ENA is opening a margin line with Bank One to facilitate NYMEX  trading through the Bank One broker.  Has Enron Corp. ever signed a standard  Master Note with Bank One?  I'd like to see what's been previously  negotiated.  Thanks.  Sara
