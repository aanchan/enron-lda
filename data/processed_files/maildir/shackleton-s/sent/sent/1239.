Julian Brent Hendry For the time being Sara is handling the Swap Master Agreements for South  America since they are ENA transactions. Attached is credit terms for Capex master trading contract (per Julian's  request). Andrea, I hoped your credit questions were answered concerning adequately in the  recent contract negotiations with Pluspetrol.  I apologize if I wasn't  sufficiently responsive.
