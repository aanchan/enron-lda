I am finalizing the docs and we should coordinate with Julian.  You may want  to let Scott Neal know that we will need his signature.  SS  Sara, I spoke to Kevin Thomas and he gave me the following address and fax. Address: 1 Jackson Square, Suite 1060, Jackson - Michigan, # 49201 Phone #: 517-768-2003 Fax #: 517-787-4606 How shall we proceed now? I guess we need Scott Neal's signature. I'll be in a couple of meetings today, but we will definitely send this out  today. Thanks, Julian
