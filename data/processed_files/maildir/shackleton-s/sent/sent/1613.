Tanya:  I just spoke with Chris about this ARCO transaction which might trade  TODAY.  We are "cleaning up" some of the language as it was based on the  prior ARCO deal (when we were ECT).  Please note that Enron Corp. previously  provided a guaranty.  I am not certain whether that guaranty is tied to the  transaction specifically and I'll try to track down.  Will ENA provide a  parent guaranty for the new transaction?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara 	Chris H Foster 		  Sara: Arco is back.  Could you please review the attached and let mw know if we can  transact under this confirm? Chris     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 Chris, I've attached a simplified confirm based on our prior May, 1999  version. The only change in the new draft is to represent the fact that we are now  using only firm energy rather than a blend of firm and nonfirm. As a result volume weighting should only apply on holidays and Sundays when on-peak and off-peak values may need to be weighted in with 24-hour firm values. On a related issue, how quickly could you have a corporate guarantee  available? Dave (See attached file: Enron_Confirm062300.doc)  - Enron_Confirm062300.doc
