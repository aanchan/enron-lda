FYI.  Maybe this relates to your PG&E counterparty. Larry Joe Hunter Kelly, On 5/11 we traded a Financial Power deal with PG&E Energy Trading - Power  L.P., EW9838.  We had previously been notified by Credit/Legal that no  Financial Power deals were to be done with this C/P.  Please advise. Thanks, Joe
