No, in general there is a netting issue with French counterparties.  The  "quick fix" is to only permit ONE Transaction using a deemed ISDA.  The  broader issue to be resolved is that one of the parties must be a "financial  institution" under French law.  We tried to push ECT into that defintion, but  without success.  The next step is to require  an opinion from outside  counsel identifying our counterparty as that financial institution.   SS             ps - Tanya is well aware of the situation     	 	 	 I'm pretty sure SITA is a French company.  Have we decided that French  counterparties are ok? Tanya Rohauer Please prepare a deemed ISDA for the SITA deal.  Please forward to Jarrod  Cyprow on the confirm desk. Please note the only credit specification is a  cross default to third party debt.  Let me know if you have questions. Thanks, Tanya 	Heather Alon
