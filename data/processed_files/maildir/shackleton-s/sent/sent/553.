Thanks for the info.  I don't need anything further.  Also, thanks for your  assistance last week and continued attention to our legal group.  Sara This was part of a normal maintenance program that moves groups of messages  with large attachments from one point to another. David is a Notes  administrator.  The return receipt was  a side effect of the message moving.   I can give you more details if you need them. Please let me know. Thanks Mark Davidson Mark Davidson David- Sara Shackleton sent mail out to four EI people.  She got a return receipt  from you.  You were not on the address list.  Can you please explain how she  received a return receipt from you? Thanks Mark Davidson Return Receipt Your document:	Re: Financial Trading in Brazil
