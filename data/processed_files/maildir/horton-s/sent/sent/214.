Ok.  Contact Cindy Stark to make an appointment.   Stan: I will be completing my tour of duty in Bolivia in September of this year. I  am talking to a number of people regarding opportunities for a new assignment  back in Houston office. Thought since I will be in Houston, stop by your  office for few minutes.  NK What is the subject matter you wish to visit about? Stan: I will be in Houston on May 11th and would like to visit with you in early  afternoon if possible.
