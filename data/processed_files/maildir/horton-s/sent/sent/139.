Please advise Danny McCarty Stan,           Now that Enron owns 100% of Wessex, we need to look into whether  Enron Direct could utilize Wessex's customer data base as a new sales  channel, and whether we Wessex could farm-in Enron Direct's invoicing  services (there is certainly money to be saved and /or made here).  Matthew  Scrimshaw (President of EES-Europe) would like to explore these and other  possible synergies in the near future.  Maybe you could schedule an hour with  him when you are in the UK. Dan
