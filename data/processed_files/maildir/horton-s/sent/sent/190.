Please go ahead and execute.  Thanks for checking with me. Resending.  I apologize-it went to your EOTT address. Molly Sample VP & General Counsel EOTT Energy Corp. 713-993-5027 fax 713-402-2806 	Molly Sample 		  As you are aware, we have been pricing an upgrade to our Computron financial  accounting program.  The vendor selected was Axes-One, which is the new name  for Computron.  To keep the project on target for implementation, we have a  quote from the vendor that is good until May 1, 2001.  This is a budgeted  expenditure and the license fees are approximately $300,000.   Dana asked that I run this by you before we get the license signed.  Please  let me know if we can go ahead and execute this agreement.  If you have any  questions, please call me.  Thanks.
