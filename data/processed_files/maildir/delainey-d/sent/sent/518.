Eric, this looks good. Regards Delainey Dave -- Attached is the memo we discussed regarding the ENA Events (both customer and  employee) and the Approval Form.  Please review and provide any comments at  your earliest convenience.  Once you have approved it, I will have it  delivered to all ENA employees via e-mail as a memo from the Office of the  Chairman.   If you have any questions, call me at ext. 3-9053.  Thanks. Eric
