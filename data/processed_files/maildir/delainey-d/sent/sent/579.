rodney, are you managing and coordinating these reference requests for ENA to  EES?  I think that these requests need to be highly controlled into the EES  organization at a high level and screened by you as being necessary or not. Regards Delainey FYI Dan Leff How about Chuck Dana at Owens Corning, Steve Messinger at GC/BICC, as well... In addition, metering customer references thru Jeff Messina should prevent  customer burn out Dan Kurt Wangenheim ENA has asked for EES customer references.  ENA is currently working with  National Gypsum and National Gypsum has asked for two references. They would  prefer manufacturers that have over 10% of their cost of goods sold as energy  and have DSM projects completed at their facilities.  ENA has solicited my  support in getting these references because when they asked EES Sales, they  found them not to be overly cooperative with supplying names out of fear that  ENA may burn out EES customers before EES Sales can use them.   Since EES customers fall under Jeff's pervue, I need your help in getting the  go-ahead to approach the account managers to set this up.  My suggestions  would be World Color Press, Package Ice, Polaroid, or Ocean Spray.  Suiza  would be a good choice if we could get the right person.   ENA has asked me to get this information to them as soon as possible since  the deal is on hold until they get the references. Thanks, Kurt
