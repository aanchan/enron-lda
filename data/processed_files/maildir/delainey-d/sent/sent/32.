As per our discussion. Janet R Dietrich I am no longer coordinating the "next-year" activities for new hires in the  gas group so I thought I'd just let you know that the Midwest gas team is  interviewing new hires for coverage/origination roles. I believe Laura is  wanting to hire some of these folks to be based in Chicago and I would think  you would want them to be located in Houston. Just fyi.
