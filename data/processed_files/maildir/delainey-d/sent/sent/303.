FYI Lets discuss Regards Delainey Hello everyone! Joe Sutton would like to have a meeting to discuss the above subject on  Monday, September 18 at 10:00 am - Houston time.  If you plan to be in  Houston at this time, please meet in Jeff's office.  A telecon number will be  arranged and we will furnish this number to you tomorrow. Due to Jeff's very busy September calendar - this is the only slot we could  get. Thanks for your support!
