Ok - you got the ball. Regards Delainey     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Thanks Dave.   This 12 MW output increase is at 90 degrees and we could  easily demonstrate this increased output with a capacity test for any  potential buyer.  Therefore, the increased sales value is real. Mitch, Mike and myself will sort this out to maximize value for Enron (and  ENA).
