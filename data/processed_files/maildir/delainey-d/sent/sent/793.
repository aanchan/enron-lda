Kay, please ensure that her expense statements are signed by me. Regards Delainey Janet R Dietrich Kay, I do not approve of the limo charge for Laura Luce's housekeeper. Laura  needs to either write her own personal check for this or deduct the charge  against her next expense report. It is imperative that this does not slip  through the cracks. Since Laura no longer reports to me, Dave should handle.  Thanks for being so diligent in looking into this.
