Mike, please let Brian know if there is a problem and let him rectify.  It is  difficult for me to be responsive otherwise. Thanks Dave Dave, This roadblock is causing us real problems. Mike     	 	 	 It turns out that Delainey agreed to allow Brett Wiggs to be the Enron  spokesperson.   I guess we'll give the current process another week or so.    I'm personally not in love with the Mitsubishi turbines anyway given the NOx  uncertainty.
