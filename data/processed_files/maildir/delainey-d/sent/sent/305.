Kay David W Delainey Jen, I would be pleased to attend - sorry for the delay on the e-mail. Kay, please set up. Regards Delainey     	 	 	 Dave: As a follow up to our conversations on the origination function within ENA, I  was hoping that you could join us at our middle marketing team meeting on  September 21 at 4:00 pm. I think it would be beneficial if you shared your  views on origination currently and its role (s) in the future. This would  also be an excellent forum for you to discuss ENA's short and long- term  goals. If this date is not amenable to you, please let me know when you would be  available. Regards, Jen 34759
