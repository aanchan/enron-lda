Janet, he can approve but can't sign as a director. You need to continue to  manage. This would take a board resolution to change (ie) he can not bind the  company as a director. Regards Delainey Janet R Dietrich Kay, as we discussed previously: Effective immediately, I would like Ben Jacoby to have signature authority  for his team's expense reports as well as all documents whose capital  commitments are not greater than $250,000. Most documents will be  confidentiality agreements, exclusivity agreements, permit applications, and  land/equipment option agreements. Please forward this (if need be) to the appropriate internal individuals who  get this set up. Thanks Kay.
