Guys, here are the details on the ESA MEH turbines - please forward to me  your project details, economics and strategy ASAP.  We will allocate these  turbines to the project with the best strategic/economic rationale once  confirming that they are worth more in ENA versus ESA.  If you need more  detailed information on these turbines please let me know. Rob, please give me call on this one. Regards Delainey Dave: The attached sheet provides a summary of information on the turbines. Brett Brett, can you give me the particulars on the four MEH turbines (ie)  scheduled delivery, price, fuel options, heat rate, output,etc - including  transferablility to NA. Regards Delainey
