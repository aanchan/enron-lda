Janet R Dietrich Congratulations to the entire deal team on the final execution of the AGL-VNG  contracts! You guys did a great job at identifying the opportunity, managing  and negotiating with the customer, managing the regulatory and legal  concerns, and valuing and structuring the deal in a win-win manner! This was  a very focused effort and managed and executed very well.  Well done!
