Kevin, how do we get at the transmission without buying the entire company? Regards Delainey Tamara Jae Black     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Please forward this to Dave and John.  My e-mail is not working for them. Thanks.     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 What do you think of a hostile bid for SOCO's transmission assets (Georgia  Power, Gulf Power, Alabama Power, Savannah Electric, & Mississippi Power &  Light), and a simultaneously create an ISO/RTO that is auctioned to the  market.  This would clearly expedite the opening of markets in the SE  significantly. I think we could get an FPL, Duke, VEPCO, Entergy, Cinergy type company to  provide a pre-negotiated purchase price for the transmission facilities so  our capital at risk would be minimal.  Additionally, we would cut a deal with  FERC on what the new market design would look like and the ultimate  transmission owner would live with the market design. What are your thoughts.
