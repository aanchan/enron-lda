Yours! Janet R Dietrich Dave, East power trading does not have any options capability now. We don't  price options very well and we have little capability to manage them  effectively. This will be a huge hindrance to deals this year. I would really  appreciate your focus on this. Janet R Dietrich Hey John. Have you worked out the green card issues with the TXU options  trader? What's the status and timeline for getting him here? Also, Bruce  Sukaly will be talking with you about Steve Wang's option's background. I  think you should talk with Steve and decide whether he can fill some of our  voids from an option pricing/management standpoint.  Thanks.
