Rob can you give Om a call. Regards Delainey Isn't this our world.   John Om Bhatia Northland Power (a power plant operator) from Toronto has joined hand with  Nepco to build a large cogen plant in BC with possible power off-take  agreement for US Pacific NW (Washington/Oregon). Northland power asked me if  Enron would be interested to quote indicative prices for this project. Would  you please advise me with who is responsible for this kind of projects?  Thanks for your help. -Om Bhatia EIM - Pulp & Paper
