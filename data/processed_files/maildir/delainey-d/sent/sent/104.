Wes, can you adjust West Power numbers for the drop in headcount. Regards Delainey Christopher F Calger Dave, You asked about office costs, depreciation and headcount: Office Costs are correct and include rent, supplies, backoffice expenses,  general marketing and charitable contributions. Depreciation includes leashold improvements (walls, carpet and paint) and  certain computers/IT not covered in the IT allocation (Tim is checking on the  $278K) Headcount is close: my actual 2000 headcount is 38, not 36 and Tim's plan for  2001 may be overstated by one or two; overall headcount increase is probably  15, not 18. Hope this clarifies the plan. Regards, Chris
