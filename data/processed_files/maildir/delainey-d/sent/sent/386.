Janet, any thoughts - do we have excess development staff - this would be a  good opportunity for the brave at heart. Regards Delainey     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Any thoughts on below? Kevin, How are things going?  Don't imagine you are too upset not having to deal  with California or the wildfires out west?  Things are going well for us  here, but as we expected it is like the US in 94/95 (things just starting)  and Europe (96/97).  The Japanese utilities are not being too original in  their approach... same playbook.  Regardless of all of this, looking at sites  and potential development of physical trading assets is starting to look  quite promising.  Jpnese cutting back on nuclear and significantly increasing  LNG and many old oil-fired plants out there are just a few of the  characteristics. You mentioned in your last email that you had significantly reduced your  efforts at adding capacity in the East.  Along these lines would you know of  anyone that might be interested in a Japan tour to get all of this going?   Ideally it would be someone at the Director level.  Let me know. Joe
