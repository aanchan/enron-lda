John, what do you want to do with this?  We had discussed but I wanted to  follow up. Regards Delainey Dave -- Sorry for the delay in responding.  Dorie has been out after surgery and I  wanted to talk with her first.  Attendance is an issue that can be addressed  via a few initiatives, including: 1) better up-front communication from the Office of the Chair through the  direct supervisors (like we did for United Way last year) 2) entertainment/big-name draw added to the line-up 3) IP-TV as a back-up for those who cannot attend 4) select a better time than last year's meeting (i.e., morning meetings have  been better attended in the past vs. last year's afternoon meeting) There are no doubt other small changes we can make to enhance attendance, but  this should get us headed in the right direction.  Dorie and I would be happy  to sit down and discuss this with you. Regardless of what we do to increase attendance, if we wish to do such a  meeting, we need to pick a date and get on the Hyatt calendar soon.  Their  calendar is filling up quickly.  Thanks. Eric     Guys, given all the change and our 2000 success, I would argue that we should  have a meeting; however, the challenge is getting people to show up - any  thoughts on this Eric/Dorie? Regards Delainey Dave and John -- In the past, ENA has held an all-employee business meeting over at the Hyatt  in April or May.  Do you plan to hold such a meeting?  If so, we need to get  started on planning the event.  Dorie Hitchcock has typically handled the  arrangements.  Please advise. Eric
