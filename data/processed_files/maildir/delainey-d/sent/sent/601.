Don, with regard to your previous message please contact Michael. Regards Delainey I am contacting you to confirm our meeting with you and some of your  be Kurt Huneke and Adam Umanoff (MD, Commercial Americas) In the last two months Enron completed the acquisition of the minority shares  (~20%) in Enron Wind Corp.   As a result of this decision, Enron has also  made a variety of changes in Enron Wind as a first step to maximizing our  return in this industry. One of the very next steps we are taking is an effort to reacquaint the  various operating subsidiaries with Enron Wind.  As the regulatory  environment evolves in North America a number of new opportunities are  evolving which should benefit ENA as a result of Enron's market position. We thought it might be useful if John Lavorato, Janet Dietrich and Kevin  Presto were available to join us as well.  Please feel free to invite anyone  else you feel would be appropriate.  As you may know, we have begun to  way we see the market developing. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this meeting. Thank you, Michael Payne Director Enron Wind 6-9690
