Can we realistically net transmission costs against CTC undercollections for  EES?  If there is a credible argument we should discuss. Regards Delainey     	 	 	 Attached is the updated exposure report for California.  There are four  spreadsheets: 1) PG&E Corp and affilate exposure, 2) Edison International and  affiliate exopsure, 3) CAISO and Cal PX exposure, and 4) Enron business unit  combined CA exposure.  We are continuing to make progress on the mitigation  of PG&E non-regulated exposures.  Please give me a call if you have any  specific questions on the numbers. Bill  3-3831 Please note: The numbers for the PX Credit have increased based on a more complete  valuation.   The P/X Credit MTM exposures are not netted against EES payables of T&D (with  netting there would be an estimated $200mm reduction in PX Credit exposure) All MTM numbers are valued at the Mid Curves. Enron Wind numbers are being reviewed. Portland General, ISO and PX exposures are estimates from last week and need  to be updated.
