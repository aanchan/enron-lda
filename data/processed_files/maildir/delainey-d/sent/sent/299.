pls set up Jordan Mintz Dave: Do you think your and Lavo's schedules would permit your coming to one  of my Staff Meetings.  We typically meet on Thursday's at 5pm, but could  easily modify.  I have an "eclectic" Group of around 35 that would enjoy the  opportunity to hear from you guys for a half hour or so with a couple of Q&As. Let me know.  Thanks. Jordan PS- Morris and I were in Calgary last week to discuss our Tax position and  mitigation strategies, Slugger acquisition (I am not confident that we will  see any benefits this year if we complete this deal.  As Rob may have told  you, it is moving real slow), transfer pricing, etc.  I think things went  really well and I would be happy to provide you with more detail, if needed. J
