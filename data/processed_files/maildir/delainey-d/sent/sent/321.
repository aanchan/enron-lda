fyi David W Delainey extend, or..... will we be able to get approval Guys, ENA will take responsibility for the two 7EA's.  We do not currently  have any projects for the Westinghouse 501D5A's.  However, I do not know what  Bowen's view might be for EIM or Haug's for CALME. Regards Delainey extend, or..... will we be able to get approval fyi extend, or..... will we be able to get approval Karen - let me know if it would be beneficial to brief Rick or Jeff.  I'll  stop whatever I'm doing if necessary.  I think on this particular turbine  purchase...... there is great interest from ENA, Calme, and EECC third pty.   I agree that in general - we can't take our eye off the ball with respect to  the long turbines.  F.Kelly
