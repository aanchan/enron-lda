FYI/action Rob Milnthorp Dave, we have come up with a structure that creates approx a C$45MM tax loss  to offset our year-end projected C$50MM Taxable Income position. By doing  this, we avoid cutting the government a cheque for roughly C$20MM. It seems  to me that we should be able to recognize that $20MM as gross margin. We are  meeting with Wes on Tuesday to discuss further but I thought that I should  keep you in the loop as it is a significant transaction that you may want on  your radar screen for your discussions with Wes.  Regards Milnthorp
