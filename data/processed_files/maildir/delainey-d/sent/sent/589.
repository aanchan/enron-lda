Regards Delainey John Sherriff It looks like we have agreement on the change below but before we send this  out can you please review and comment: In order to streamline all of our commercial credit trading activities  globally, Jeff Kinneman's Debt Trading team has been merged with  EnronCredit.com.  All global credit trading and EnronCredit.com activities  will co-headed by Jeff Kinneman in Houston and Bryan Seyfried in Europe and  the group will report to John Sherriff - CEO of  Enron Europe. We wish both Jeff and Bryan well in their expanded roles.
