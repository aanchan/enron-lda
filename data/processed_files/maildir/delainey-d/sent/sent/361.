Mike, lets discuss just after Wayne and I get together to discuss the  technical book or in conjunction. Regards Delainey Dave and Dave, Wayne Mays and I are trying to assess technical support requirements for the  next 12-24 months.  We would like to talk with each of you to get you input  on the direction the company is going, and what type and level of support is  likely to be required as we go forward. If possible, we'd like to schedule a brief (30 minute) conference call,  preferably within the next week, with each of you to discuss these issues.   If you have a time that would be convenient, please let me and/or Wayne know  so that we can get it scheduled. Thanks! Mike Coleman
