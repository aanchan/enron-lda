Charlie, your call - just a question Charles Vetters Dave: Our term sheets tend to be very general until we reach some sort of economic  deal.  Our group has tended to work this way, but I am willing to add more  detail as you suggested. Regards, Charlie David W Delainey Charlie, looks pretty general - only comment is what is the Product Purchase  Agreement entail? Do we want to go into more detail on the nature of the alliance, the target  market and the nature of the excusivity (ie) wholesale renewables  applications, ENA, major state programs - all of it based upon the Conneticut  job working? Regards Delainey Charles Vetters Please review.  I believe this term sheet is in line with our discussions  earlier today.
