Joe, thanks for the message. It has been my experience that people who have  had experience in our trading, mid market and structuring groups have a  better overall understanding of how Enron (ECT or ENA) looks at value and  manages risk.  Personally, this is the track I took which included a very  solid foundation in accounting, operations, trading, structuring and then  ultimately in origination. I hope this helps. Regards Delainey Dave- You mentioned in enside that some of the skills needed to succeed at Enron  are solid structuring skills as well as a grasp of the the accounting, legal,  commercial and credit implications of a deal.  What is the best way to obtain  these skills?  Do you believe it is necessary or worthwhile to work a trading  desk to truly understand how ENA functions? Thanks, Joe Short
