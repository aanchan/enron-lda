John, completely agree with your view - David, I would have the matrix, with  all of the ENA statistics and names, ready for distribution on Friday to the  key managers to try and illicit a response from the low participation folks. Regards Delainey I hope the data on these performance reviews is wrong.  I think we need 100%  of reviews done.  Do you agree.     	 	 	 Attached, for your information is a matrix reflecting the status of completed  reviews from the mid-year 2000 process.  This is broken down by ENA  organization units, as they were structured at mid-year, prior to the  creation of EGM and EIM. I will provide you with a weekly update on the status. Please call me at X36628 should you have any questions.
