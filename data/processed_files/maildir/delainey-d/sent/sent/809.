Guys, given all the change and our 2000 success, I would argue that we should  have a meeting; however, the challenge is getting people to show up - any  thoughts on this Eric/Dorie? Regards Delainey Dave and John -- In the past, ENA has held an all-employee business meeting over at the Hyatt  in April or May.  Do you plan to hold such a meeting?  If so, we need to get  started on planning the event.  Dorie Hitchcock has typically handled the  arrangements.  Please advise. Eric
