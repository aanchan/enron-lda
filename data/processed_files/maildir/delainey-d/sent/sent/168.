D'Arcy, sorry I missed you last week. I am going to be down in Rio mid  November for some meetings with the S American team. Maybe we can have a  discussion then? I would very much like to get your opinion. Regards Delainey David, I am in Houston for meetings on Thursday afternoon and Friday, Oct  26-27.    Do you have 30 minutes for me for some discussion on commercial opportunities  in regards to electricity in Brazil, regional natural gas and crude oil and  products - including some perspective on our present execution capability and  competitive profile.  David, can you point D'Arcy in the right direction in ENA or ESA. Regards Delainey I would like to introduce myself for consideration to working within your  respective groups, but also including some commercial ideas relative to the  South American region and elsewhere.   I would ask at your convenience for confirmation of your interest, or not,  and availability for meetings during the week of Oct 16th-20 in Houston.    I am available, in the meantime, to respond to any information you need,  including clarifying any of my experience at or prior to Enron. Thank you in advance for any effort extended in my behalf.
