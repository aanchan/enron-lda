I agree with Jeff - we need to have a more concrete plan and capability. Let  me know what you want me to do. Regards Delainey     	 	 	 I think it's time to review our disaster plan with respect to trading as we  enter hurrincane season.  As I understand, there is no real cohesive plan, or  course of action.  We could think about the Chicago office as an evacuation  site for redundant trading, etc. This issue affects all businesses, and Sally  and I have been talking about this problem.  John, should I get in touch with  Phillippe or do anything else?  Jeff
