Mike, duly noted; however, there will be at this point no change in the scope  and function of Redmond's group. Thanks Delainey Role? Dave, Congratulations on an apparently expanded role.  I know you have a lot more  important issues to deal with at the moment, but will the Enron Americas  organization result in a change in the role of the technical group and  resource requirements?   When you have a chance to discuss the implications  (if any) it might be worth discussing. Also, on a personal note, if there are new roles associated with the Enron  Americas org for which I might be qualified, I'd certainly be interested in  any new opportunities that come about. Thanks! Mike
