FYI Christopher F Calger Dave, I spoke with Frank Gardner, the acting President of the mine.  The mine has  shut down due to high power prices and they are evaluating reopening it later  this year.  John Malowney in our mid-market group has covered these guys very  made numerous proposals to them during the past year.  Montana rejected  these, including the attached proposal that offered to fix prices well below  the current forward market price.  John has also proposed various  cross-commodity (copper) deals with our MG affiliate.  John will discuss  their situation with Frank and I will follow up from time to time.  I do not  think there is an attractive generation opportunity as Montana is net long  and the industrials' credit is marginal.  We will keep you posted if anything  materializes.  Regards, Chris John Malowney Chris, I called MRI but Frank was too busy to take the call so I left my name  and number and said if nothing else I'd see him on the 5th of October.  Just  so you'll know, attached is a sample Term Sheet that I have previously showed  MRI.  Note the prices that were "too high" at the time.    John
