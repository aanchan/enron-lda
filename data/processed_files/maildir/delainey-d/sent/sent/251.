Marion, the leads include Heather Kroll and Ozzie Pagan in the Eastern  Origination Group and Michael L Miller in the Principal Investing Group. Regards Delainey David, Congratulations on the Fuel Cell venture.  I have been trying to get Enron  interested in this technology for many years.  I am glad someone found the  right formula.  I would like to discuss applications of Fuel Cell technology  and where Enron intends to take this product with someone in your  organization.  The press release did not disclose who the lead promoter in  your organization is.  Can you direct me to the right person? Best regards, Marion Cole
