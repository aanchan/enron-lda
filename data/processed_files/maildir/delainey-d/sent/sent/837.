Guys, great job on this one.....  2001 - should be a big year for Mexico:    a) equity sell down of the Monterrey project;    b) close and further sell down of the Tex Mex project; and    c) 20% growth on risk mgt volumes and income from 2000 levels. Thanks for the great work. Regards Delainey Dave: Attached FYI is the official word from the Lenders' counsel regarding our  financial closing. Have a great New Year.
