Chris, that is correct. See you then Regards Delainey Christopher F Calger Dave, this includes my senior team (Parquet, Mcdonald, Vickers, Thomas).  I am  correct? Regards, Chris PS - I spoke with Tim and we will be ready to price energy and ancilleries  with respect to SDG&E.  I will work with Steffes on timing, pr and SDG&E  strategy.  Sorry I sounded negative, but I was voicing Tim's concern as  well.  Our risk is significant; we just dont want to make it worse.
