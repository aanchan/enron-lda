Janet, the CALME organization does not exist so it might be difficult to  negotiate a transfer price - we need to just do the right thing for Enron -  if you think you are getting stuffed economically then I would work a deal  out with Lavo or Whalley. Regards Delainey Janet R Dietrich I do not think ENA should cover the IDC's prior to us taking this turbine. It  would be appropriate for us to pick up IDC's going forward. Your thoughts? Ben F Jacoby Janet: Did you happen to talk to Dave about whether his agreement on the 501D5A  included taking the IDCs? FYI, they total about $2.5 million. As I mentioned,  CALME wants to move the turbine off their books as soon as possible. Based on  our conversation on Friday, I have told Jody that we will not accept the $1.2  million they paid in error to Siemens Westinghouse, and that I was checking  on our position on the IDCs. Please let me know what your and Dave's position  is on this. Regards, Ben
