You guys need to manage this....... Janet R Dietrich Hey guys. I'm hearing through the grapevine that we now have a new ENA  Analyst trading program. Allegedly, phone calls are getting ready to go out  from HR to offer these individuals a spot in the program and possibly a  different compensation program along with it. Allegedly there are a couple  "targeted" Analysts within Origination.  What's up with this? If there is any truth to this we need to discuss. If  not, please confirm so I can appropriately manage.
