Brian, good memo - I think you mean't Energy Capital Resources not Enron  Capital Resources in your memo.  I would distribute widely in the management  ranks. Regards Delainey Brian Redmond Dave: I would like to send the attached memo to the heads of the orig groups  describing the working relationship with Tech Services.  I would also like to  follow this up with quarterly meetings with each of the groups to review  resources, deal status, technical risk mitigation.  The meetings are not  intended to be a technical audit, but to provide a vehicle to coordinate  priorities and spot potential issues before they become problems. Comments? Brian
