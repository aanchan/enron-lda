Roger that - book 'em Dano. Regards Delainey Rob Milnthorp Dave, I had a call from Bradford today and he has Buy's sign-off on  recognizing U.S. $1.1MM credit exposure reduction as a result of our efforts  on securing a 3rd charge on Beau's assets (additionally, the 3rd charge  follows the assets with the Murphy credit upgrade). It is important to  continue to send originators the right signals re credit mitigation and  therefore I feel it is imperative that we grant the $1.1MM as origination to  reward those efforts. Please advise that you are in agreement, and we will book asap.  Regards Milnthorp
