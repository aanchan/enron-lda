Rob, I spoke with Paul.  Eric didn't rank high enough. Regards Delainey Rob Milnthorp Dave, thanks very much for the options...much appreciated (and unexpected).  Lavo had let me know that both Davies and Tycholiz were receiving options  also. Do you know if and what was done for Paul and Eric? Please let me know  at your convenience. thanks, milly.
