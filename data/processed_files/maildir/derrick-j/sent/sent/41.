FYI Vicki:  I am familiar with the firm, but we have never used them to represent  any of the EFS companies to my knowledge.  I am certain that we do not have  any current matters with this firm.  You will note that they do not appear on  our list of approved counsel.  We typically use Reed Smith in Pittsburgh.  I do know some people at this firm if I can be of any assistance.  I went to  law school with Artie Rooney at Duquesne University.  You may know that his  family owns the Pittsburgh Steelers.  Let me know the particular attorney you  are having difficulty with and I will help in any way can.  By the way, New  Power's ads have hit the airwaves in Pittsburgh.  I am enrolling as a New  Power customer!  Thanks, Marty Vicki Sharp Marty,  I assume we do not have a relationship with this firm.  Please let me  know if I am incorrect.  Please let Marc Manly know of any relationship your group has with the firm  mentioned below.  Thank you.  JIm Jim:  please see the attached, from Joe Halprin.  Does the Enron family have  any relationships with the Klett Rooney law firm that we should bring to  their attention?  In all events, please be aware that they are taking a  particularly adverse position.  Thanks.  Marc Marc:  In connection with a dispute regarding a commercial arrangement  between NewPower and Campus Dimensions, Inc. (also known as College Credit  Card Corporation), Campus Dimensions, Inc. ("CDI") has engaged the law firm  Klett Rooney Lieber & Schorling - headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA - to  represent them against NewPower.  Klett Rooney has conducted themselves in a  fashion that I would consider to be particularly unreasonable.  I would like  to know if Enron has a relationship with Klett Rooney or CDI. If they do, I  would recommend that the firm be removed from further engagements. Thanks.
