fyi thanks eas I can also ask Randy Rich at B&P.  He does alot for Becky Cantrell and will  probably know off the top of his head.  Let me know! First, on the Control area services agreement, (1) Add "Area" after Control  ESE".    Also, Whalley will be "                        "  (I'm checking what  his title will be and I'll call you so we can finalize and you can initial  it). SCC was a power purchase agreement.  The new agreement is a tolling agreement  on the pipeline?  or would ECT?  Several months ago, Stacy Dickson called and  gas  (as opposed to ECT, which does this under the FERC blanket, I think).  I  told her that I didn't know and she said she didn't think that the particular  this.  Therefore, as I recall, I did not get an answer to this.  I also have  not looked into the gas side of Genco (see note below).  I thought that Becky  Cantrell and Julie Gomez handle the gas side for ECT.  If you want me to  check into this type of question on the gas side, let me know.  I can also  ask Sam B. who may know right away.  (I have not worked on the gas marketing  side, just the pipes, so I would need to look this up.)   Laurel Bolt I had a thought this morning.  The three plants are fueled with gas.  GENCO  buys the gas from ECT, and then transports it to the plant.  Is there any  FERC reporting requirements related to the gas transactions? Thanks, Laurel
