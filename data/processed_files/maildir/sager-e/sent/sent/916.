Elizabeth -- This letter is excellent.  Attached I added several  suggestions.  Primarily, I suggest adding to the begining paragraph a few  words and a sentence to put into perspective what is going on for the quick  reader.  Also, on the mention of FERC, I suggested a ( ) to place into  context and lighten the sting.  Lastly, when you use "Commercial" I suggest  using "commercially reasonable" if that would be the ultimate standard  applied.  Just suggestions -- use as you like.  Later JOE This letter has been revised from the earlier draft to reflect comments from  Kevin and me.  I will call Bill Rust and read the letter to him after all  revisions have been made.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  We  would like to get the letter out to TVA as soon as possible, preferably this  afternoon if possible  Thanks Elizabeth 36349
