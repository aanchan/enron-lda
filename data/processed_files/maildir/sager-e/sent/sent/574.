fyi 		  They probably don't need it.  Have them call Tanya. Bill Elizabeth, I work for Georganne and we are trying to find all the pieces in the risk  books.  It would be very helpful if we could get the appendices that are  mentioned in the document below.  Could you help me with this? thanks Can you please forward a copy of the letter we sent out Tuesday morning to  Georgeanne Hodges so that she has all of the correct values?  Thanks.
