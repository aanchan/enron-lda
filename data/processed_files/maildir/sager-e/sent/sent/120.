Here is a draft of the PCA brief prepared by Dewey (head law firm of group  effort).  Sam Behrends at Laboeuf is reviewing ( we just got today so he has  not done so yet).  Sorry I didn't call you earlier about this. 		  Attached is a draft of the joint intervenors brief in PCA v. FERC.  Comments  on the brief are due by close of business tomorrow.  Intervenor Brief -- PCA Mime-Version: 1.0 Attached for your review is a draft of the Joint Brief of Intervenors in the  PCA proceeding at the D.C. Circuit.  As you know, the Brief must be filed with the Court on Friday.  Thus, to ensure that there is sufficient time to address issues/concerns, we request that Intervenors provide comments as soon as possible on Wednesday.  Please bear in mind that the Court has allotted Intervenors 8,750 words and the current draft is right at that limit.  Over  the next day, where appropriate, we will add citations to the record, include  other citations such as case name short cites, and shorten quotations.  We look forward to your comments.
