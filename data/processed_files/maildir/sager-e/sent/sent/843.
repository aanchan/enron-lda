Enclosed are those documents I believe would be impacted if we elect to use  Power Master (already in existence ("Old CSA")).   Draft enclosed, including one marked to show changes from CSA currently in  place between ENA and ML.  2. Schedule to ISDA - Part 4(F) would reflect New CSA rather than Old CSA.   Revised Schedule attached.  3. No Amendment to Power Agreement would be required.  (Delete document  named "Power Amendment 1).                                                                                 (black-line version)
