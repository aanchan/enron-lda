Mike Curry Elizabeth,  Could you please review Alabama Power's attached Terms and Conditions.  All  bidders must clearly state exceptions to these T&Cs in their offer.  They say  any exceptions will affect the value of the offer to Southern. In addition, you should have received last week three summaries regarding  interconnection structures with Southern at Caledonia.  That interconnection  review you are doing and this review of the T&Cs are necessary for us to bid  on the RFP on Feb. 24th.  So if you could get back to me on Feb. 18st, that  will give me a few days to formulate a proposal.  Also, depending on what you  think the feasibility of an interconnection is, I may not submit a proposal  at all since it costs $10,000 to propose. Thanks for your assistance, please do not hesitate to call me with your  thoughts - Mike
