	Steve C Hall 		  I have attached ready-to-file drafts of the letters necessary to terminate  the CalPX, I am reasonably certain that a FERC filing is required to  terminate the Participation Agreement because it is a power purchase/sale  agreement, the form of which is on file with FERC.  Just to be safe I  prepared the transmittal letter, notice of termination, and notice of filing  necessary to file with FERC.  Among other things, I requested waiver of the  60-day notice period. I'll wait for further instruction before doing anything else on this matter. Steve
