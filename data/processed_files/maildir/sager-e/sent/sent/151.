	Janice R Moore 		  a followup note on this deal from Kevin Presto Regards, Janice EB3861 Assistant General Counsel, Enron North America Corp. 713-853-1794 (Fax:  713-646-4842) 	Kevin M Presto 		 John, We need to make sure we are valuing the spread option using only No. 2 oil in  Dec, Jan & Feb.  We will almost certainly be curtailed during blow out events  in the winter and, therefore, it is not appropriate to use nat gas as the  winter fuel.
