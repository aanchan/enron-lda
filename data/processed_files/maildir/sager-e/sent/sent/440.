		  FYI. John Llodra All: Here is a rough first cut at a DASH for a potential deal with NSTAR to serve  their Default Service.  Jim/Zach - please fill in all relevant numbers  relating to volume/pricing, etc.   Also - please begin to get RAC in the loop  with respect to this position and VaR impacts, etc.  Others - please review  pertinent sections and edit/expand as appropriate. Timing on this will likely be quick from this point and thus I would like to  try to have a completed draft by COB today or first thing tomorrow.  We have  goes well there, we could be asked to sign a binding agreement by as early as  Wednesday. Please call me to discuss.  978-449-9936.  Thanks John
