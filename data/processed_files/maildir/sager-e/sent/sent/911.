This letter has been revised from the earlier draft to reflect comments from  Kevin and me.  I will call Bill Rust and read the letter to him after all  revisions have been made.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  We  would like to get the letter out to TVA as soon as possible, preferably this  afternoon if possible  Thanks Elizabeth 36349
