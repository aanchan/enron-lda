I believe that initial performance/credit assurance such as a guarantee to support a collateral threshold should be excluded from this definition, otherwise you would be reducing the overlimit amount by the amount of the guarantee posted at the time of contract execution. Your comments would be appreciated. Regards Lou Vitale ACES Power Marketing LLC Ph:  317- 344-7111 Fax: 317- 344-7001 Cell: 317- 696-9466  - Andy Katz.vcf
