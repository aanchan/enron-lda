	Shari Stack 		  	 Elizabeth asked me to let you all know that MS has proposed to have a conf.  call on the 14th to discuss their draft Collateral Support Annex. We plan to  participate. Please email me any comments you may have -  in advance of the  14th of course! Thank you,  Shari    	Elizabeth Sager 		  At the last EEI meeting there was a strong interest in beefing up the  collateral provisions of the EEI (what a great idea).  Bill McCoy at Morgan  Stanley was asked to prepare the first draft, a copy of which I am forwarding  to you for your review. Please review and let either Shari or I know if you  have any comments or thoughts - while EEI's message does not indicate when  comments are due ( I have a call into EEI but have not yet heard back), I  have asked Shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch  with EEI within the next week or so.  Thanks for your input. 		  To All: Bill McCoy has completed an initial draft of a credit annex for consideration  by the drafting committee and interested working group participants.  If you  provide your comments to me, I'll circulate them.  Bill is willing to have a  conference call to discuss when everyone is ready. Andrew S. Katz, Director Industry Legal Affairs Edison Electric Institute 701 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C.  20004 Voice:  202-508-5616 Fax:     202-508-5673  Proposed Draft for an EEI Collateral Annex Andy,  As discussed, heer is MSDW's proposal for a draft version of a Collateral Annex that can be used in connection with the EEI Agreement (it would be advisable for a clause to be included in the EEI cover sheet incorporating the collateral annex by reference).  We are offering this draft as a starting point for the industry's efforts to develop an EEI Collateral Annex.  Please feel free to distribute it and let Ed or me know if you would like to have a conference call with others to determine the next steps in getting feedback.
