David  Can you look this over. Thanks 	Christi L Nicolay 		  MAIN/MAPP organization.  Can you have some corporate type comment on these  attachments?  Thanks.  Christi -- yes if we will be a member.  Later JOe I don't see anything glaringly wrong in these, but I am not a corporate  lawyer.  It seems to have section balanced voting at the committee level  (except that each member gets one vote at the "parent" level, section 6.5 --  how is balanced voting assurred there?)  Also, it takes one year to withdraw  (section 5.7)  It seems like the timing should be shorter, perhaps, 6  months.  ,I assume that MAPP and MAIN have hired corporate counsel to draft  these, but JOE do we need to have one of the Enron corporate lawyers look at  these? Comments?? attached is a draft of the bylaws and articles for the proposed RRO, combining MAIN and MAPP; we have drafted it as a Delaware entity due to the uncertainty as to where it will be located John McGrane ************************************************************************ The information contained in this e-mail message is intended only for the personal and confidential use of the recipient(s) named above.
