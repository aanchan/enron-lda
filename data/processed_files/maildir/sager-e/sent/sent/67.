	Rogers Herndon 		  David -  Please review the insert that Entergy provided.  They have requested that the  Into Entergy System Border includes... "from an interface that has sufficient  ATC posted that will allow for the purchase of Daily Network Designated  Resources on the Entergy Transmission System." I am ok with this b/c the def of an into product requires firm trans to be  avail to sink into the CA (Entergy in this case).  In the event firm is not  avail, then supplier can take LD risk associated with non-firm trans. Entergy agreed with this interpretation. Also, because this is a large deal for them, they need to get approval from  higher levels. Please provide me with some feedback as this deal is critical to my trading  position/strategy. Thanks, Rogers Let me try this again. Thanks, --Phil Attached is a revised Confirmation Agreement for the 4th Quarter Entergy transaction.  Rogers, I am coming to the floor to confirm withyou the Contract Price provision, and that prescheduling would occur on the prior businessday.
