Hi  Will you call you later to discuss Shari and Elizabeth,      We revised our CAISO language to address the 10 minute pricing implemented recently.  See attached.  Do you plan to change your language also?  As you can see, I took the easy way out and did not reference either the 10 minute price or the Hourly Ex Post Price -- I just said the price paid to CAISO by the Buyer.  Do you think this works? -Dede (See attached file: CAISO LANGUAGE 092500.doc)  - CAISO LANGUAGE 092500.doc
