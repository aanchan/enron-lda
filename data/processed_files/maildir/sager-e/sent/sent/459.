Do these numbers include both EES and EEMC with respect to both PGE and SCE.   If not I need them all combined. Thanks for your help. Elizabeth 36349 		  Per Mike's request, the attached note has our latest estimate on PX credits.   We are expecting to have a final estimate by Friday.  Let me know if this  timing works for you.  Thanks.       	Enron Energy Services 	 	 Our current estimate of PX credits thru Mid March is ~$570MM including the  large, but I'll get you an update asap.
