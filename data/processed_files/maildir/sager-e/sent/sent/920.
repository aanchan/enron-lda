Please respond to "Wholesale Electric Contract Standardization Group"  Paul Pantano clarified my earlier email about the CFTC proposal.  Sorry for  the confusion. Andrew S. Katz, Senior Attorney Edison Electric Institute 701 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C.  20004 Voice:  202-508-5616 Fax:     202-508-5673  CFTC Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii Content-Disposition: inline Dear Andy:      I want to clarify a misunderstanding in your email to the group.  While  it is correct that the CFTC proposes to regulate commodities with exhaustible and nearly inexhaustible supplies differently, it has not characterized power as having an inexhaustible supply.  In fact, I would expect the CFTC to treat  power as having a finite supply at any given time.  This means, for example, that power derivatives traded on a multilateral transaction execution facility  would not qualify for exemption from the Commodity Exchange Act under the current proposal.  I think the EEI and other industry groups should consider  attempting to persuade the CFTC to exempt physical and derivative power contracts from certain provisions of the CEA under the CFTC's proposal to consider exemptions on a "case-by-case basis."  See, for example, the discussion of DTFs on pages  9 and 10 of the proposal.  I hope this clarifies the CFTC's proposal.      Regards, Paul Paul J.
