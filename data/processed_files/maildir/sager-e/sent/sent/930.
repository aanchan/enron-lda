Genia would you please send master (with riders) to stuart w/ note that we are  currently revising and will resend latest version when finished (2-3 weeks) thanks Stuart Zisman Attached is a form of Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement.  I believe  that the provisions that you are looking for are contained in Section 3.5.   The only concern I have is that the attached may not be the latest and  cover damage language will not need a substantial overhaul).  There have been  numerous discussions about this form being revised.  By carbon copy of this  email, I am requesting that Elizabeth Sager forward to each of us, the latest  and greatest form if it has been finally agreed upon. Stuart
