	Edward D Baughman 		  Elizabeth: The attached list is a follow up to our discussion (i.e., IPALCO's problem  contract) on existing customer contracts and mid-market's initiative to  dramatically ramp up short term deal flow. This list represents  counter-parties we anticipate transacting with frequently. Please advise as  to problem areas. Thanks. Karla Compean
