	David Portz 		  		  Dave and Ed, We closed two option deals with TVA last week.  They have sent the following  comments on our standard confirms.  Dave - Rogers has already commented on the 16 hour call.  His comment was  that this is a 16 hour call, all or none, not up to 16 hours.  Secondly, the  option is exercisable in 50 MW blocks (increments of 50MW) not a minimum of  50 MW.  Please look at the rest of the language and let me know your  thoughts.  Thanks. Ed-  there are some credit additions on page 3 under credit assurance.  Let  me know what you think. Thanks guys. -Joe
