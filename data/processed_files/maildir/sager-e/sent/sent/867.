Greg Original email that was sent to me, also was suppose to be sent to  you, but  it went to the wrong Greg Woulfe.  So here it is.     Also, date of filing is wrong.  We want to file this Friday, the 21st. Let me know if you have any thoughts/changes. Thanks Elizabeth  36349 Twanda Sweet We are planning to file suit against Calpine next Friday.  Please review the  attached draft petition and let me (ext. 35587) or Laura Gibson  (713-844-3003) know of any comments or changes. Thanks Richard Richard B Sanders Richard, I have attached a draft petition in the Calpine matter for your review. Our preliminary assessment is that the probability of a successful outcome is low. I am doing further research and will call you tomorrow to discuss this matter. Thanks. Laura  - calpine orig pet.wpd
