	Janet H Moore 		  My top 5 are: Duke Energy Corporation (High) Consolidated Edison Company of NY, Inc. (Medium) PG&E Energy Trading-Power, Inc.(Medium) ConAgra (Low) CMS Marketing Services (Low) 	Shari Stack 		  	 I have it on very good information that the Credit Dep't is staging a  "workathon" this week and Bill B. has promised Elizabeth that if we give her  our top 5 CP's for whom we need credit input/info (credit worksheets,  follow-up calls, etc.) - we will have the information we need by the end of  the week.  Some in Credit have even brought their sleeping bags to the  office. They appear to be taking this very seriously!  So..... Elizabeth asked that we each give her the names of our top 5  Counterparties for whom we need Credit input/info. We need to give her the  names by 10 am tomorrow (Tuesday).
