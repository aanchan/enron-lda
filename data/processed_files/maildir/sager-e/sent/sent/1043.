	Mike Curry 		  Below is the Entergy contact.  I will get back to you asap on how the desk  intends to trade off the WSPP so you can prepare a memo for the traders.   Thanks, - Mike Rogers Herndon Mike -  I just spoke to my contact at Entergy.  They have moved exclusively to the  WSPP contract to streamline their contracts department and protect them  against inconsistent contractual language.  They are not bending on this  requirement at this time.  As such, I think we need to proceed with signing  this agreement unless there are any significant issues.   Could you coordinate the execution with legal ( I think E. Sager was working  on this).  Arlyn Kelleher is the contact on Entergy's side.  Her # is  281-297-3582. Kevin, Kyle, Elizabeth - are there any significant issues that would prevent  us from executing this contract?  We need them as a counterparty and I do not  think sleeving is the answer. Thanks, Rogers
