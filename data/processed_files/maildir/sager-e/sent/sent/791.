TVA supplied the basic changes and we intervened in a couple of cases where  we did not think they met our agreements. My  comments to are as follows: I believe the second bullet is better stated than the original one we  submitted. We support this wording. In the last paragraph, if Enron also supports the wording related to ENNA and  ENCA we need to include your name in the sentence. Please disregard the original document and let's work from this one. Thanks Jim  - att1.htm  - SERC Enron TVA ResolutionRev2.doc
