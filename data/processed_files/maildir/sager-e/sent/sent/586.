Peter and Mark Can you go ahead and give Dave a call to work on Canadian Master Thanks 		  Elizabeth:  Good to hear from you.  David Anderson is immersed in the agreement, and he should be the one youwork with on it (415-973-6659; stand-still agreement, which, as I last understood it, had only one remaining issue, namely, the wording of the drawing provision for the LCs. Can we get that one behind us, also?  Thanks.  Larry Hi Larry I spoke with Peter Keohane and Mark Powell from our Canadian office and they would be available at any time today, Tues the 8th , to go over the Canadian Gas Master between ECC and PG&E.  Let me know what time works for you. Thanks Elizabeth 713 853 6349
