Here is a brief memo prepared by Dan Watkiss relating to the relationship  between TVA transmission and marketing.  N  I will call you later to discuss TVA letter. Kevin does not want to make  offer to sell at market based rates.  Also want to discuss if there is any  way we can challenge TVA on the hourly tag problems of last week. Talk to you soon. Thanks 	Christi L Nicolay 		  ES--Bob Madden may be interested in this.  If TVA is not formally separated,  (from ENSE to AEP, for example) and TVA marketing not taking us as an  upstream if we do that are really interconnected.  Maybe Bob can come up with  something. Bill--Does TVA ever buy transmission on any other TP's system?  It must not  or it would have to file it Practices as a OATT with FERC.  Does TVA just buy  or sell at its border?  Thanks.  - 0125650.01
