fyi lets discuss later Please respond to "Wholesale Electric Contract Standardization Group"  Paul Pantano has sent me a newly released proposal by the Commodities Future  Trading Commission on how it will streamline regulating various markets.  It  has made a distinction for electricity trading based on its characterization  of it having an "inexhaustible supply". Based on this distinction its  oversight over electricity trading will be less comprehensive than other  commodities.  I am sure Paul would be willing to answer further questions you  may have.
