Shari FYI  Here is a confirmation I prepared (very quickly) for use with Entergy (that  weird customer who will only use WSPP) when we need to do a firm deal under  the WSPP. 	David Portz 		  Attached is a revised Confirmation Agreement for the 4th Quarter Entergy  transaction.  Rogers, I am coming to the floor to confirm withyou the  Contract Price provision, and that prescheduling would occur on the prior  businessday.
