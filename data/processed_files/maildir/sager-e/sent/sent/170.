Genia Can you please forward this to all lawyers in the power trading group. Thanks 	Mark E Haedicke 		  Effective today, there is a new legal review procedure for physical power  contracts that are individually negotiated, with a term longer than one  year.  Please notify me (Janette will maintain a list of contracts,  counterparties and status) when drafting starts on such power contracts and  provide me with a draft with sufficient time to make comments prior to  closing.  My objective is to insure a consistent approach on these power  contracts.  Thanks for your cooperation in this matter.  Please forward this  memo on to the lawyers on your team. Mark Haedicke
