per my vm 		  Attached are clean and blacklined drafts of the Enron guaranties to be made  Purchase Agreement ("PPA") and Green  Premium Sharing Agreement ("GSPA").?  The guaranty for the PPA is blacklined against the Enron EPC Contract  guaranty in favor of the banks which was granted in connection with our  Cabazon Wind Power Project (the project most recently financed by EWC) and  the GPSA guaranty is blacklined against the PPA guaranty.  As we discussed  last week, since the Enron guaranties will need to be in a form that will  acceptable to our project lenders and equity participants, we thought that we  should start with a form that was used in our last financing and that was  negotiated by Enron and the banks.  We plan to use the same basic form for  seller's obligations under the PPA.  We will forward the draft of that  guaranty to you later today.  Please feel free to give me a call if you have  any questions concerning the attached guaranties.  Thank you.  - PPA Guaranty.doc  - GPSA Guaranty.doc  - REDLINE GPSA Guaranty.doc  - REDLINE PPA Guaranty.doc
