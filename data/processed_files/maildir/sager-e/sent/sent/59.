	Kevin M Presto 		 Do we need a pre-meeting?   Quite honestly, Dynegy's position is not  unreasonable - it forces the sinking utility to assume the transmission risk. I understand the EEI position and long term it is definitely the right answer  from a liquidity and MTM accounting standpoint and I will clearly support  that position in our discussions with 3rd parties. The ultimate goal for ENA is to go away from Into products completely and  trade power within zones of RTO's or ISO's where transmission and congestion  is managed by an independent operator with all transmission costs passed on  to the load.
