	Michael Danielson 		  FYI Michael I received a call from your attorney a few days ago; she was  inquiring about the status of the draft of the power sales agreement.  .  I misplaced her number; therefore I did not get back to her.  Please apologize to her for me.  We have not spent much time with your draft because we feel our positions are so far apart that  NES's time was better spent working with those suppliers that understood the program and were comfortable with the program.  We have one contract signed and are negotiating with two other suppliers.  Is there any point to sending ENRON a copy of the agreement NES is will to sign or has ENRON decided it has very little interest in the program as it is structured?
