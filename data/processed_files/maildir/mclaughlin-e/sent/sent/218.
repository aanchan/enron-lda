Please change these.     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Errol- These are still showing Bankers Trust International. Can you please change  them back to Bankers Trust. Thanks.     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Errol- Can you please rebook those two deals back to BT. (QT6916 and QT7116) Thanks. Done-OK per Credit who gave instructions to suspend. It looks like Bankers Trust Company (CP# 27) needs to be unsuspended. Jason Moore     	 	 	 Jason, Per the below notice from Legal.  "Bankers Trust" is still a valid Trading  entity, and we should continue to book Trades to this Entity.  Can you please  change GCP from "Suspended" to "Active". Thanks, Joe Deutsche Bank has gotten back to me and is vacillating on what they want to  do with the Bankers Trust trades.  In particular, they haven't thought  through what they want to do with the online trades, don't like on online  documentation, and now they think they may want to do a full novation of the  trades once they decide how to resolve this.  So, until we hear back from  them (they said in about a week), just let the Bankers Trust financial trades  and master sit.
