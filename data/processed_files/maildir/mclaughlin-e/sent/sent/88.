The deals in the worksheet below have been flipped out.  In the future please  Can you make sure that this gets done? Thanks Stacey Vallejo Hi guys, I took the liberty of looking in the NG-PRICE book to see if any deals were  missed, and came across a lot.  Here are the deals that need to be flipped to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book before 2:00pm Houston time as I need to get invoices off to the customers today. There are about 40 other deals in this book that still need to be dealt with  for January settlement, but these ones need to be fixed right away.  I've left a phone  message with Laura, but haven't heard back yet, and I think that Sherry is still out of  the office as she hasn't changed her outgoing message to say that she's in the office. If there are any problems with this message, please let me know. Thanks for all your help Stacey
