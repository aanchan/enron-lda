Errol McLaughlin This deal has been changed to a NYMEX swap at $8.14. Thanks, Errol     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Hi Errol.  Have you had any luck with these two deals? Thanks, Diane     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Hi Errol & Sherry, We received confirmations for the above referenced deals from Paribas (they confirm us) and Paribas' confirm differs from what we show in TAGG.  Paribas' trader, Herve, says that he spoke with John Arnold after the deal was done  and changed the price from 8.15 to 8.14 and the index from Gas Daily to NYMEX.     TAGG still reflects the terms that EOL has.   Can one of you please find out if John Arnold agreed to these changes, and if so, can you make the necessary changes to TAGG?   Let me know. Thanks a lot, Diane 3-0443
