Conoco, Burlington, and Oneok have all expressed an interest in participating  in the Open Season... Kevin Hyatt Open season responses are due from shippers on Friday 11/17.  Please make  sure you canvass all your customers to find out who plans to respond and who  doesn't.  I would like to submit to Steve a list of who we expect to see  responses from, their anticipated volume, term, and price they're willing to  pay. thanks KH Kevin Hyatt This week, make sure you call all your customers (if you haven't already  spoken with them) and discuss the non-binding open season.  Answer any  questions they might have, and reiterate the response deadline.  See if you  can get an idea if they plan on responding one way or the other.   thanks KH
