Rick, we are going to be running project payouts for Puerto Rico on Mark's  numbers ($317mm valuation) and Mary Joyce asked that you approve the  valuations due to the size of the project.  Can you please respond via email  so that I'll have documentation for my files.  Thanks. Pam This is our summary model If you have any questions please call me at 33569. Thanks Mark
