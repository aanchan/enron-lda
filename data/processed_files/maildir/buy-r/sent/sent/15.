fyi, rick John L Nowlan Recognizing we were just below daily VAR limits today, coupled with the high  volatility in the crude and products markets, we attempted to do an interday  calc. Unfortunately it took us some time to get the right person but we did  succeed in getting an  estimate right at the close which showed we were very  near our limits as we were yesterday. I flag this up to point out it is  critical in these ,markets that we have some cover or know who we can call if  we need this type of interday analysis.
