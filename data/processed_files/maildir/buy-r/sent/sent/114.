Please be sure this is in some legal record or something so I don't have  problems with this in the future. Thanks, Rick     	 	 	 	 Rick Buy, the Business Unit Head for the RAC group, and I logged onto his  computer on Friday, January 26, 2001 to review information for an  investigative effort so Mr. Buy's name does not come up in a random search  for accessing inappropriate websites.  If you have any questions, please call  me at Ext 30649. Thank you.  Sheila Walton HR Director
