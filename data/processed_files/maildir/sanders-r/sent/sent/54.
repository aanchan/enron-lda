Mary Hain Here's a draft.  Tim and I changed the "not a big deal bullets" to be more  precise but to keep the airline concept.  Tim hasn't proofed this, but I  wanted to send you the draft for your interim consideration and understanding. Please review the attached document and call Steve Kean or Mark Palmer with  any questions or comments  you may have as soon as possible. Thanks.
