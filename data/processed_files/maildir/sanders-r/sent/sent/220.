Linda-- Please check with Stuart Kusin at Susman whether we agreed to return  this material. Otherwise tell Kevin to archive it. 		  Richard, I still have approximately 10-12 boxes of supporting documentation  accumulated over the life of the FJ Energy Alliance.  Should we send these to  archives, destroy, or back to FJ? thanks Kevin Hyatt x35559
