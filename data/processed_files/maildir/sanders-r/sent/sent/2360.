The posting of this bond should eliminate the need to pay on the Enron Corp  guarranty. Please refer all future correspondence regarding this matter to  Bonnie White     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Richard, I am told that the supersedeas bond will be FedExed by our surety to our New  York counsel for delivery tomorrow.  I am hopeful that we will have it filed  in the court by tomorrow afternoon, and a copy served on Louis Epstein.  When  I have word that the bond has been filed with the Court, I will let you know.
