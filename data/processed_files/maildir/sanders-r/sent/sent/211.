Even though I have not seen te bill, I do have a concern that it will prevent  us from making our 3rd Q earnings. How bad is it? 	Peter Keohane 		  Dan Fournier phoned this morning to say he is sending you his initial  account, with a copy to me.  If you or Mark have any concerns please let me  know. NOTE:  We have set up a separate RC for Stanley so that all costs are billed  back to Lavorato.  Your assistant can call Linda Sietzema for details  (403-974-6708).
