I have asked my paralegal, Linda Guinn, to get you this information. As a follow up to our meeting that was held on 9/25 regarding year end legal  circularization, I would like to obtain a list of the outside legal firms  utilized and the associated legal matter.  Please forward this information to  me or Jennifer Stevenson at your earliest convenience.  We will be providing  this to our corp team as they prepare for their required year-end procedures. Thank you for your help.  Please give either myself (3-6109) or Jennifer  (3-4793) a call with questions.
