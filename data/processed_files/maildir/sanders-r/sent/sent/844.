	Richard B Sanders 		 Looks good. I would send it from me to Lisa Urrick at the PX instead. What do  you think? 	Steve C Hall 		  Gary, The only suggestion I have for the letter involves your reference to the FTR  Auction.  I would propose that you revise 2(b) of the letter to read as  follows: b. Has the CalPX made any attempts to have the ISO apply the approximately  $80 million in proceeds from the ISO's recent Firm Transmission Right auction  to PG&E and Edison's ISO real-time charges incurred while the CalPX was  acting as Scheduling Coordinator for the two utilities? Here is the original sentence:  "b. Has the CalPX credited the $80,000,000 in  auction revenue for the Firm Transmission Rights from the auction held in  January in any of these chargeback calculations?" The FTR proceeds are held by the ISO, not the PX, making it impossible for  the PX to credit the IOUs for these amounts.     Steve Christian Yoder Let's try to think this through today.---cgy     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 Here is a draft letter to the CalPX for your review and comments. Thanks.
