John Odam has asked me to go to lunch w/ his new partners. Would you like to  go? If not, how interested are you in sending them work? I think John is a  great guy but he did a marginal job representing EBS on some litigation I was  managing. 		  Richard:? How bout April 4 or 5?? You,  plus whoever else that we discussed  who might be available.? Y'all are our  guests of course.? John Odam
