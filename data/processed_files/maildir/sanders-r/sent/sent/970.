	Sheila Tweed 		  	Mark Mullen 		  I have instructed Jerry Odom, our FVP site representative, that all accidents  reports he receives regarding the injury accident of the Jomax employee last  week are only to be provided to myself, Jake, or Sheila.  Jerry received  reports today from Jomax and CIG but NEPCO is still refusing to provide  theirs.  Please let me know if there is anyone else you would like on  distribution at this time. Regards, Mark
