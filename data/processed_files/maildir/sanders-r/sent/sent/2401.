ENRON         There's a videoconference at 2200 Southwest Frwy -- but you have to reserve a  space -- call Dawne Davis (phone numbers below).       307-778-4240 307-778-8175 - fax In keeping with Mike Moran's instructions to be frugal, I did not book a  video conference at Enron, but I have asked Linda Guinn to find one that we  can attend in Houston.
