Britt-- I can't find them. Either Wayne Gresham or Gail Brownfeld has them. 	Twanda Sweet 		  Richard, do you have these documents? Twanda Sweet Enron North America Corp. EB3821 (713) 853-9402 		  Some weeks ago, Richard sent me copies of some demand letters dated in  November to the "ENA Legal Department" that he suspected had been laying  around somewhere, and asked me to investigate.  I have had one meeting with  Enron's mailroom people, who I gave my only copies of those letters.  They  threw them away, thinking I had finished my investigation.  I have mentioned  this to Richard and asked him to send me additional copies, but it may have  slipped his mind.  Can you help me? Thanks. Britt
