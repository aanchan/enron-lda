Now I remember. Call me if you get this in the next 20 minutes. 		 This is the matter I have been working on for Enron Metals.  Enron Metals  hired Pan Ocean as charterer.  Enron Metals needed to ship some metal from  somewhere in Asia to Baltimore.  The ship was arrested in Hawaii in November  and has not sailed since.  We are going to file an arbitration against Pan  Ocean seeking to recover the damages we have suffered as a result of not  being able to get our product to Baltimore.  Estimated damages: approx. $1  million.  We hired Heallie & Baille back in January to assist (not Leroy). 		 what is this case? 		  Enron Metals is considering filing a breach of contract arbitration  proceeding against Pan Ocean Ltd. and Panobulk America. If you are aware of any reason that Pan Ocean Ltd. and Panobulk America  should not be sued, please call me at 713-345-7105 or e-mail me by the end of  business on Monday, March 26, 2001.  If I do not hear from you by then, I  will assume that you have no objection to Enron Metals instituting this  litigation. Thanks for your assistance.
