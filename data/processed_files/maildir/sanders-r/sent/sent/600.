What do you think about Bill as a trading atty? 		  Sanders - Anything ever come of that trading job we  were talking about.? I  saw a deal from Prescott the other day looking for a  "electrical trading  atty for an international energy company".? It looked  like the job you were  talking about so I sort of assumed that our discussion was  a non-starter.?  Let me know.? Thanks - Gage ? William A.
