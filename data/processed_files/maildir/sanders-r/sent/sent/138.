I have asked Linda to get back to you personally about the status of this  bill. 	Please respond to bogden 		  Richard:  Our accounting department still shows the $17,312 invoice unpaid and 120 days out. Is there anything you or Linda could do to assist in clearing this up? Thanks in advance for your help. Best regards, Bill
