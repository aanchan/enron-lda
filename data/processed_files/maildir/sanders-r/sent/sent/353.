Jim has known about the dispute since June, but I can't remember whether I  called him about the lawsuit. I left him a voicemail 5 minutes ago. 		  Richard, have you told Jim about this, as Britt believes?  Its a $6 million  case and an answer is due on October 16. Bob, Currently, the Litigation Unit is providing advice and counsel.  At the  suggestion of Richard Sanders, Grant Harvey of Gibbs & Bruns will be  attending the meeting scheduled for Friday between ExxonMobil and Enron,  given his representation of ENA in a suit with KN over the Bushton plant.  No  decision as to outside counsel, however, has yet been made.  Bob Vote recalls  hearing that Richard Sanders has advised Jim Derrick of this matter, and one  of us will provide a short voice-mail report of the Friday meeting to Jim  afterwards. Let us know if we can answer any further questions. Britt  	Charles Cheek 		  Please respond to Bob's inquiry and copy me. Also note that Brownfeld  requested a copy of the complaint as served earlier this week on EE&CC.  Thanks. 		  Do you guys know who is handling this?  Does Jim know about the suit?
