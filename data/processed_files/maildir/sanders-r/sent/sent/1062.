You know Mark Haedicke well. The meeting on the 9th has been cancelled in  favor of the Thurs call. 		  Richard:  when Carl and I were down in HN a few weeks ago and met with you  and Mark, Mark had suggested a meeting on May 9th in HN to discuss all of the  status of all of the litigation matters and to coordinate with the various  in the PG&E case and in the PX case (or through the Creditors or Participants  Committees).  Do you know if that meeting in HN is still on or has that  meeting in person been "overtaken" by the Thursday afternoon litigation  update calls?
