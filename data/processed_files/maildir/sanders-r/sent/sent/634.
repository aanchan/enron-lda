		  Today I received a copy of the Correct Consolidated Complaint in the  FirstWorld Securities Litigation.  I am happy to report that Kevin and Steve  are NOT listed as defendants, which effectively dismisses them from the  case.  I will be sending a copy of the Complaint to each of you for your  files.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you.
