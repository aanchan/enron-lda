		  Would you forward to the correct Michael Brown for me?  Thanks. Robert C Williams Richard, Rob has asked for some input on the proposed Draft Hague Convention relating  to jurisdiction and the enforcement of foreign judgments.   One of the new  proposals could have implications for trading.   The proposal would arguably  subject a company to suit in a jurisdiction where it has an accessible  website for conducting e-commerce.   However, under the Convention this grant  of jurisdiction would apparently (I am still studying this) be overridden by  a contractually-agreed forum selection clause.  Do our current e-business  contracts contain a forum selection clause?  Would you anticipate that we  would conduct trades in the future without a previously-agreed forum  selection clause? Thanks for your help.
