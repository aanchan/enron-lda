	Mary Hain 		  transmission FYI - In case you haven't seen this.     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 In case you haven't heard, the Supreme Court has granted cert of our and the  state of New York's cert petitions on the extent of FERC's jurisdiction over  transmission facilities. Mime-Version: 1.0 Attached is Lou Cohen's (of Wilmer Cutler) write up of the Supreme Court's  grant of two petitions for certiorari in the appeals of FERC's Order No. 888  on transmission open access.  While too much should never be read into a  grant of certiorari, this seems to be auspicious for Enron and to validate  Joe's conclusion that it would be imprudent for Enron to rest on its victory  in the court of appeals and not oppose proactively New York, et al. who are  asking the Court to expand the native load exception.  It should also be  noted that the broadside against FERC's authority to act (the Dalton cert.  petition), which Enron took the lead in opposing, was rejected outright.   Enron's brief is due in 45 days.  Joe and I shall meet with Lou early next  week to get this process started.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Supreme Court Action in FERC Cases Here is a  summary.? I included the cites just in case.? Let me know if you  need  more. ? The Supreme Court  today granted two petitions for certiorari to review the  D.C. Circuit's decision  in Transmission Access Policy Study Group v. FERC,  225 F.3d 667  (2000).? The Court granted the petition of New York and other  states (New  York?v. FERC, No. 00-568)) to consider?whether FERC may preempt  state  jurisdiction over transmission of energy from generators to retail  customers in  the same state.? (The Court declined other questions?New  York?had  raised.)? The Court also granted the petition of Enron Power  jurisdiction to  regulate all transmission in interstate commerce, including  transmission for  bundled retail sales, and whether FERC is obligated under  the Federal Power Act  to eliminate undue discrimination by requiring  transmission-owning utilities to  provide service on the same terms to all  users, including bundled retail  sales.? The cases will be argued together,  probably not before October  2001.
