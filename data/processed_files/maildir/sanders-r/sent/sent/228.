	Richard B Sanders 		 I am sorry that it took so long to get back to you.  My paralegal, Linda  Guinn, is the best person to answer these issues. Her ext is 36104. By the  way, we are not revising our policies. 	Richard B Sanders 		  		  Richard:  We have learned from Bob Williams that you are in the process of  updating ENA's document retention policy.  What will the policy be with  regard to retaining drafts of agreements after a particular transaction has  closed?  It is our understanding that ENA's current policy is to discard all  drafts post-closing.   We are in the process of formalizing our own document  retention policy, and want to ensure that our practices line up with ENA's.   Please advise.  Marianne (EES Legal)
