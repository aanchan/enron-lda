Yes 		  Michelle Blaine has requested a flat screen for her computer.  Please let me  know if I can move forward with fulfilling this request.  Thanks! I need to order a new computer battery for Gail Brownfeld, as her current one  has a broken connector.  Also, Michelle Blaine has requested a flat screen  for her computer.  Can I order these from IBuyIt, or do I need to get  approval from someone first?  Thanks! Stephanie M.
