		 Last note from Kate and others invovled show that this company is either ENA  or EEL, not EECC. I suspect Kate will be fixing her records to show that.  Thanks to all and sundry. 		 Sorry Bob--too late, this case belongs to you. Seriously, I have asked Britt  Davis to help me sort this out. He has been heading up the effort to  (finally) get rid of this case 		 I think Richard Sanders is managing this litigation.  The other party is  Interfert.  And John, trust me, since I managed this while at ECT (nka ENA),  you don't want to give Richard any reason to transfer it to you (or to me).   Its a pain.  Besides, I can't imagine that this would be under EECC, but the  accounting boys never cease to amaze. John Schwartzenburg Yikes! Justin, if you folks are litigating a case involving this entity,   then EECC needs to be aware of it, including myself as the GC and our  litigation managers, Bob Williams and Gail Brownfeld. Can you please let me  know what  the nature of  the case is, including it's status, and which Enron  lawyers are handling it? Kate, it might be that entity is just improperly shown as an EECC entity.  Justin, can you tell us who the Enron commerical people involved with the  case are? Hello ther I understand from Justin that this is ongoing and will not be finalised until  outstanding litigation is resolved.  I understand that you guys in Houston  are running this one? Sue. 09/10/2000 16:06 	 John - I knew that this was tickling my memory and suddenly I remembered!   Back in 1997 John Echols was appointed liquidator to continue the process of  liquidating Enron Gas Liquids Europe S.A.R.L. (which I presume is the same  entity to which you refer).   By copy email I'm asking John Echols, Sue Kelly and Justin Boyd what happened  to the liquidation proceedings.  Does the entity still exist and if not, how  can we get copies of the liquidation evidence. Thanks Kate Kate B. Cole Director, Corporate Services Enron Corp. Tel: (713) 853-1624 FAX: (713) 646-8007 		 Hi, Kate. It surely can wait that long.  By the wasy, we have another company that somehow has been allocated to us,  Enron Gas Liquids, a French Company, that EECC was surprised to find it owns  and has no use for, so we would like to liquidate it as well. Is that  something your gang would handle as well, just to make sure that no other  Enron entity needs it? Hopefully this can wait until w/c 10/9 as Teresa and I will be out of the  office until then.  Teresa will send out a dissolution memo to ensure that  everybody is on the same page and then Corporate Legal will prepare the  documents.  You don't have to do anything else! Thanks Kate Kate B.

Please  tell me what I need to do to accomplish this task. Thank you for your help in this matter, Wyndi
