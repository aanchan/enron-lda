Do you have everything you need? 		  Richard- I just wanted to follow up on my requests attached below.  Additionally, we  haven't received a response from Gibbs & Bruns.  This isn't a problem right  now as we are still probably at least a week away from signing an opinion.  I  just wanted to keep you informed.  Let me know if I can send someone up to  get copies of the documents.  Thanks for your help. Russ Russell Montgomery Richard- I have two requests that I hope you can help me with.  First, I wanted to see  if there was an executed document removing Intrust.  If there is, I would  like to get a copy of that.  Also, you mentioned a "side letter" agreement  drawn up to allow the GPs to have the right to remove Intrust.  I would also  like to get a copy of that document.  Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, Russ  3-5297
