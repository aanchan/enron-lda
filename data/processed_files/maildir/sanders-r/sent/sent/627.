Bonnie--could you call him and find out what this is about? Thx. 		  Should I suggest that he get in touch with you or Bonnie? 		  Mr. Cheek: I got your e-mail address out of Martindale.  I need to set up a corporate rep depo to get information concerning an employee of Enron Capital and Trade who lives in Dallas and offices in Houston.  Could you refer me to whoever in your office would handle that, so I can set it up with a minimum of inconvenience to all concerned? Thanks, Bart Wulff
