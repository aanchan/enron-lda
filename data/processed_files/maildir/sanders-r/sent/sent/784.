	Randal Maffett 		  Robert/Richard - Montauk called yesterday and they've reached a tentative  settlement w/ WMI at Davis St.  They sent the most current draft but I can't  open it.  I've sent a message back asking them to resend but thought (at  least Robert) y'all might be able to open it and provide feedback.  Please  call/advise asap.  Thanks! Per your request, please find attached a draft of the Settlement Agreement by and among Waste Management, GSF and Ecogas.  Please have the draft reviewed and provide me with any comments you may have as soon as practicable.  If it is acceptable, I  will have an execution copy circulated for signature. Thank you for your assistance.  You can contact me directly at 412-393-1503. (See attached file: Davis St. Settlement)  - Davis St. Settlement
