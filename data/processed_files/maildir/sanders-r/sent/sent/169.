Sorry-- Twanda knows the drill. We have a temp. Mr. Derrick has sent this document to me to expedite with V & E and himself.   In the future, please send these litigation documents to me.  There are  things I have been instructed to do with these documents for all lawyers  before Mr. Derrick or Vinson & Elkins sees them.   Thanks, Steph.
