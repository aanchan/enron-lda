	Shonnie Daniel 		  	Rob Cole 		  My trip has been postponed so I will be in the balance of the week. I would like to secure an affadavit(s) from payroll (stating he was not our  employee) and human resources (stating no employment file exists for this  gentlemen and that no employee benefits were offered/paid to him).  Is this  something that you can assist me in obtaining or would you prefer I work with  our Litigation Unit in order to obtain?  In the meantime, I am writing back to the attorney requesting the Wyoming  cases he is relying upon.  Also, I am going to request his clients damages as  a result of this incident and a copy of their commercial auto policy.  Thanks, Rob Rob Cole Shonnie, I am faxing you another letter received from the attorney for the  other party.  I will call you sometime next week in order to formulate an  appropriate response as I am leaving the office momentarily until next week.   Thanks, Rob
