Can you please call her and get this worked out. I asked her to send me the  invoice. Richard, your name is on here too, Linda never answered my e-mails.  Any  ideas?  I don't think this is Apachi's. Paula Parrish PAULA J  PARRISH         PAULA J  PARRISH         Hi Linda, I am Director of Accounting/Reporting for the Apachi region (Asia Pacific  Africa China) and I'm hoping you can help me with something.  We have  received an invoice from Enron North America for outside legal costs for  something called Havmann.  No one over here seems to know what that project  is, but your name appears on some of the correspondence. Looking at the backup for the invoice did shed a bit of light though, because  some of it mentions charterers liability I vaguely remember from my EGLI days  (too many years ago) that the Havmann was an LPG tanker.  Is it the same ship? Can you let me know how this issue relates to Apachi, and what project it  is.  I'm hoping you can provide an answer in the next day or so as this is an  issue for February close. Thanks a bunch and have a good weekend, Paula
