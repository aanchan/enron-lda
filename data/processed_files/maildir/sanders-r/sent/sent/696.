yes 		  Please reply to confirm receipt of this message.  I've received a handful of reports that folks in our email groups are not getting some messages, even though our software shows them in the groups, confirms transfer of the messages, and we get no undeliverable messages back. Sorry for bugging you, but we're trying to determine the extent and cause of the problem.  Thanks. Don.
