Sean Casey George informed me of the pending situation with Peabody and I told him that  when I was with Pittston we had a  dispute with the NS railroad which hinged upon the fungibility of coking  coal. Pittston's chief technical guy was George Denton, now retired and , I believe, is available for consultation. George is  highly respected and has a vast amount of data and experience . Please advise me if you would wish to talk to him. Thank you Sean Casey
