I don't know anyone over there well enough to recommend them, so my interest  is low. However, I have no objection. Are we interested in adding Porter & Hedges to our list of approved  litigation counsel?  Mark Glatzer of that firm has called me and requested a  meeting or lunch.  I don't want to encourage him if there's no hope.
