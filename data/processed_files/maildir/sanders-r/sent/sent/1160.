		  I would ask Mike Smith. Action before Bankruptcy Court PG&E want to fight the TURN accounting as it, basically, wiped out hopes of  collecting their undercollected amount from a regulatory accounting  perspective.   The company has said they need to keep the old accounting  convention alive, as it would bolster their chance for recovery in the  litigation on the just and reasonable argument in Federal District Court. Bob -- Monday, May 14 PG&E asked the Court to stay the PUC's March 27 Order on  accounting procedures.  Where is this going?  This would be very bad. Jim
