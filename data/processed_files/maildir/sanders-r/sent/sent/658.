I sent the resume to Michelle Cash, who now heads up recruiting. 	Tana Jones 		  Richard, Below is the resume of a friend of George Hope, a member of the Online Team.   As head of legal recruiting, if it meets the needs of any particular group,  please pass it on. 	George Hope 		  Shari,  I hope that you had a good holiday. This resume is a very good friend of  mine who wants to get on here at Enron and I wanted to forward her resume on to you. I was hoping you could take a look and let  me know if you have any needs in your group or if you could recommend that I send it to any other groups. I have spoken to Tana Jones who  said that she has no needs at this time, thank you for your time.  George Hope
