Did you talk to her today? what do I need to do to follow up? Sheila Tweed Would you have time to contact Linda Green or do you want me to do it? Karen E Jones Hi Sheila.  For a headhunter in the NW, I'd suggest Linda Green.  Perkins  Coie uses her, as do (it turns out) PGE and ECI.  She also does work for  Intel.  Here is her information:  Green and Associates  2701 NW Vaughn Street, Suite 450  Portland, OR   97210  (503)224-9601 Hope this is helpful.  Did you get my message about Andy Wu?
