I am the logical person to speak with B of A. I need to speak to Joel or Lisa  to put  B of A's request in perspective. 	Lisa Mellencamp 		 		 joel: i think that if b of a wants info about the lawsuit (just filed) that best to  talk to richard sanders only, not leboeuf. he is handling primarily and will  be careful about what to say. richard what do you think? this is connection  with  b of a doing due diligence on increasing their sub debt line to east  coast power.

Should one of our litigators be  involved in this discussion? When Bill gets back to his office (around 3:30 ECT) we will give you a call to discuss.  If possible, it would also be helpful to get an update on progress made on understanding the claim filed by Infineum and possible meeting times later next week to discuss the case with LeBouf, Lamb. Dean  cc:  Great.  Look forward to discussing it with you later today.  Dean   cc:         I just checked with Bill's secretary and she said it should have come   throug   about 5 minutes ago.      cc:             Bill should have sent you a fax with an additional sentence clarifying   the    attached letter.  I think Bill was also going to suggest a time to   discuss    today.  Please call me when you can to follow up.
