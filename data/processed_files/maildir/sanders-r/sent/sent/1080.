I would like to attend if possible. If not--good luck. 		   Allen and Indiana counsel talked yesterday. We have a conference call in the  works for Monday with Kevin, Allen, maybe Wayne and Indiana counsel.  You're  welcome to attend.  Richard, Wanted to drop a line to see if you had any word/guidance on the  termination/dispute language.  Can you call me early next week? KJM
