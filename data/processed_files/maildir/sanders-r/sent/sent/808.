	John Enerson 		  John Enerson Attached is my first attempt to frame the applicable provisions regarding  Enron's obligation to increase its Stabilization Fund letter of credit by  $4.5 million on the Completion Date.  It appears that the major issues are  (1) can they pass the Endurance Benchmark (24 day test) and (ii) that the  estimated cost to complete the facility is in excess of amounts in the  Interest Subaccount, Construction Fund, and Equity Contribution Account.  I  am currently thinking that if it cost more than $4.5 million to complete the  facility, senior lenders may not want to pursue completion in order to obtain  our $4.5 million.
