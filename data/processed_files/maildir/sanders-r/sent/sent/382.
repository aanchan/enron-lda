Are we still on for Sun night?  I will let you decide where we are  going.--somewhere near you is fine. 6- 6:30 is best. We will be with the kids. 		  October 8 it is.  I used the message at isbell's house to send you a message and erased the body.  We are going just the four of us and the kids.  Where do you want to meet?  what time? cc: Mayor Isbell's house                     09/28/2000 03:35 Does October 8 work for you Richard?
