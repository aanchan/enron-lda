FYI 	Darren P Adamik 		  FYI... Jeff Shankman and Fred Lagrasta are trying to change Enron's Tape Retention  Policy from four months to forever on a number of individuals in their  group.  Due to the inner workings of our recording system, selective tape  retention is impossible.  It is a all or none type of situation.  Please  review this email and our current Tape Retention Policy and decide what  course of action is needed.  As you know this email is not enough to  permanently stop the company's retention policy.  A new policy would need to  be drafted and signed by John Lavorato and yourself before this could occur. If you have any questions, please call me at 853-4764 Regards, Darren Adamik Mgr.-Trading Technology Barbara Lewis Barbara Lewis Per Jeff Shankman- The attached document reflects the ENA Gas Risk Management & Middle Marketing  Groups. Everyone who appears on the list has a recorded line.  I am aware that all  tapes are destroyed  after a certain time period; however, it is imperative that these particular  tapes are never destroyed. Please archive these tapes in a secure location. Many thanks, Barbara Lewis
