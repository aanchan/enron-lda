It has either been settled or abandoned, but I haven't heard anything about  the dispute in weeks.     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Richard, Has the dispute with Duke Energy International been settled? Thanks! Marie I asked Bob Williams and he stated that as long as the dispute has been  settled then there is no need to keep documentation.  You might want to  confirm this with Richard Sanders who worked with us on this issue.   Regards, Brent Brent, Sara asked me to e-mail you to see if we should purge all of the  documentation in connection with the recent dispute? Thanks! Marie
