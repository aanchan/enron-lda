Andy Edison (andrew.edison.com) will be the future rep. on this committee. 		  It is not clear to me what precipitated this most inquiry from Anadarko or why it is being made at this time.  I thought that we had gotten over this hump. Assuming that you are not anxious for this task, I propose that I tell them that, because you are currently tied up on other matters, I will be the temporary representative on the committee and that after the holidays we will be back in touch further. Such a response would parry this somewhat odd inquiry / statement, and will allow us to reassess the situation when Andy gets on board and gets his feet wet.
