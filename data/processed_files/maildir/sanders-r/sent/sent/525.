		  This is not good.  It seems as if Rozja (Peace's right hand man) or the CPUC  handed Hoecker the questions and he said:  "Oh, I'll take care of getting the  answers to these for you!"

Attached is a list of questions Chairman Hoecker has proposed to parties that  spoke at the Nov. 1 (I believe FERC means the 9th) meeting.  All but No. 3  are  directed to Enron and the responses are due on Wednesday the 22nd.  - EL00-95.1
