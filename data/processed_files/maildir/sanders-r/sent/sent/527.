The status of the case has not changed. On Monday the 27th the court will  hear our Motion for Summary Judgement on liability. We expect to win. Badack  is contesting the damages and we will be required to endure some discovery. I  predict we will have a judgement that we can excecute on by the 1st Q. Badack  has increased its settlement offer to $2.4 million. We have offered $4.5  million. 	William S Bradford 		 Badak is still in dispute.  Our litigation team headed by Richard Sanders is  still negotiating with the company on some possible settlement.  We may need  to write this balance down at some point.  I am not sure when to expect  resolution to our negotiations.  We will keep you posted as it progresses. Bill Brant Reves Bill, Where do we stand with Badak? thanks brant Mary Lynne Ruffer Brant - Can you give us an update on Badak?  Thanks. Maybe you should speak to Bill Bradford or Brant Reves.  I'm not sure I have  the latest news.  I can say that we terminated the positions and invoiced  Badak after they failed to deliver (this was several months before my move to  London). If you'd like we can arrange a call with you, Bill and myself (I'd like  someone from Houston to be involved). Rod Mary Lynne Ruffer Rod - We still have a receivable on our balance sheet for Badak.  Can you  update us on the status?  Thanks.
