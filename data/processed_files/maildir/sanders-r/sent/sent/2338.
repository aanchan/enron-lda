I  will be happy to do it this way. By the way, if you are sending a copy to  Bill McCartney at V&E, you should know that I am also sending him a copy.  Richard, in the future, could you please have your Assistant forward the  reports to me.  Previously, Mr. Derrick did not have e-mail and his mail was  diverted to me automatically by the system.  Now, it does go to him and I  have to go in and send it back to me.  Mr. Derrick reads the reports after I  take care of the administration of them which involves copying, filing and  forwarding on to Vinson & Elkins.  This is the procedure he has set for me.   I don't mean to complicate your life further, but would really appreciate it  if you could do this.   Thanks so much, Steph.   Stephanie Harris Attached is the weekly ENA Litigation Status Report.
