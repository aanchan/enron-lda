303-294-4499 		  Thanks, Richard.  Do you have a tel # for Mike?  Thanks.  cc:  Duke LNG  It's a two way street, of course.  Have they expressed any interest in  negotiating?  There is nothing wrong with a REAL negotiation,  but nothing  particularly helpful about generating one that s just for show.  Particularly in the absence of any entreaty from them.  Where is the "simple" explanation of the transportation piece?  As I have told RNR, I think we should advise Duke in writing  that its IP is  not in conformity with the contract, sinceit is in the  alternative, and  that  our IP is hence the only one that will be before the  arbitrators (since  Duke  clearly cannot change it's ineffective IP at this stage,  having already  seen  ours).  Accordingly, the only issue left for arbitration is  whether our IP  (the only one and therefore the one they have to choose) is  or is not an  economic hardship under the contract.  What say ye?   cc:     Here is an action item list for the Duke LNG dispute.     Items                                                   Responsible     1.
