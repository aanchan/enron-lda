Here is what I want to do on this. I need to review and approve all bills. I  do not have to the sign off on the required documentation. If it makes Britt  more comfortable, fine I'll do it. But I do not need to do so. Linda, Just wanted to follow up regarding signatures on the invoices.  Becky  Stephens cannot process the invoices without an authorization signature, so  we need to know how you want to handle this.  Since there were no questions  noted on the invoices, we have assumed that you found them to be in order. Please contact me as soon as possible.  I received an email from Holland and  Hart this morning regarding their invoices and Beatty's office has contacted  me about their January invoices. Thanks for your help. Becky  Becky Zikes Linda, Becky Stephens received a stack of invoices for the above cases today that  appear to be ones you sent to us for processing.   However, they do not have  approval signatures.  Do either you or Richard want to sign off on them, or  do you want Britt to do so with your authorization? Please let me know as soon as possible so we can get them processed. Thanks, Becky
