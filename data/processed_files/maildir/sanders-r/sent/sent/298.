	Christi L Nicolay 		  Joe Hartsoe has previously arranged for Richard Tabors (Enron's economic  consultant) to meet with FERC staff and Craig Baker of AEP (for AEP to  explain certain practices to FERC.)  Please contact Joe 202-466-9150 to  coordinate whether this should take place in light of the discussions that we  had today with outside counsel at Gibbs & Brun.  Thanks.
