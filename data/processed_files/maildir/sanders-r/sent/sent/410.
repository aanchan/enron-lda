	Alan Aronowitz 		  Janice: After his trip to Singapore, Mike McConnell recently requested that Bob  Williams (and possibly Mary Nell Browning) get up-to-speed on the First Gas  contract issues to see if Bob can help in any way. As you may recall,  Bob  (and Mary Nell) had assisted Mike on the J-Block contract litigation and  settlement. Bob has set up this call to get some background. Matt has prepared a note on  the background, which I have forwarded to Bob. Matt has also prepared a  package for Bob, which is supposed to arrive by courier in the next few days.  I will forward Matt's note to you as well. Thanks in advance for your participation in this matter. Alan The call-in number for the First Gas Conference Call is below.
