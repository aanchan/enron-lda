Thanks for the update. Andy will be handling this one. 		  Rob, in your absence, Bonnie White made demand on Morrison on Friday.  A copy  will be forthcoming to you.  Monique provided a copy of the applicable COI.   Sorry you were not kept in the loop.  Lisa It is suggested that the above lawsuit be assigned to Bob Vote as its  practically identical to the Gene Rice matter that we are currently handling  together.  Like we did in that case, this matter should be tendered  immediately to the plaintiff's employer, Morrison Construction, whose  carrier, Zurich, assumed our defense and acknowledged us an additional  insured. It appears service occurred on 2/20/01, and that an Answer is due within 30  days or by 3/22/01.  Please advise - thanks- Rob
