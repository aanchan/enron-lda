I thought these were taken care of long ago. I think they relate to Neal's  work for EES on the chilled water project for Enron Field. Let me know. I still have all those old "counseling" invoices on our "accounts receivable watchlist."  They total $9,500 and some are more than a year old.  Any chance of getting them paid so we can be clean at the end of the year?
