		  FYI.    B.K.D. Britt Davis  PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY  WORK-PRODUCT  Attached is a recovery/exposure evaluation in this above-referenced case,  for your review.  Please remember that if ELFI wishes to proceed with  arbitration, we will need to circulate the usual "conflict check" memo to the  general counsel first.  I await your instructions.         B.K.D.
