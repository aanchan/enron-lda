Linda Guinn Enron North America 1400 Smith Street Houston, Texas  77002 (713) 853-6104 (713) 646-3393 (fax) 	Alan Aronowitz 		  I believe I had sent to you a reply earlier this month to your memo to me  regarding how to allocate the outstanding inovice to cost centers (e.g., mine  or Richard's). In my reply, I indicated that I thought that since all of the  work done by Watson Farley in the attached invoice was in anticipation of an  arbitration, the bill should be paid from the litigation RC. If you would  like to discuss, please let me know. Please confirm that the invoice has been or will be paid soon. Thanks for  your help.

I've spent quite a lot of time  reviewing it with Neale and already expended quite a bit of goodwill between  us to get the bill reduced. We shouldn't delay payment further. Thanks for your help. Matt Matthias Lee Britt not include independent FGH work. Although I have found the bill in order, I  Regards Matt Matt, This will follow up on my recent e-mail regarding the substantial initial  portion of that bill related to resolving the FGH issue, Richard has asked me  to review and apportion that  bill between his R/C and Alan's R/C.  Subject  to Richard and Alan's thoughts, however, I wonder if it makes more sense to  ask Neale Gregson to do that for us, given that he was the one that spent the  time. I await your response.
