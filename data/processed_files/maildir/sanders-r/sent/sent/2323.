Please print out this memo with attachments and place it in the Calpine  lawsuit file     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Confidential.  Privileged.  Attorney Client Work Product. Laura: As discussed, attached are materials gathered in-house as to ERCOT Summer  1999 price movements, consisting of (i) a chart of high and low ERCOT B  product prices for each trading day of the summer, as published in MegaWatt  Daily, and (ii) articles from the Megawatt Daily indicating unusual price  movements in the same period.  Our "InfoCentral" employee has indicated as to  the latter that articles published on August 2, 3, 16, 17 and 19, 1999 made  reference to "next summer", and may thus on their face be indicative of  altered forward price curves.  Please contact me with any questions or  comments. David      	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Javier
