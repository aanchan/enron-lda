Other than the Taub case, I don't know of anything. Linda? 		  Please take a look at this e-mail and let me know if you are aware of  anything. Thanks. 		  Andy, Lease Company or any other party affecting the Leased Facilities. The Leased  Facilities are the Houston, Bammel and Texas City Loops and the Bammel  Storage Facility including the compressor sites and compressors as well as  meters. Currently the Leased Facilities are leased by HPL Assets Holdings LP  HPL under the sublease. Can you let me know if there is any threatened or  pending litigation involving these entities or assets specifically--as always,  I appreciate your help-- Sandi
