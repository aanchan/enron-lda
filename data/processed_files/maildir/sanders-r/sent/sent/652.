	Robert Walker 		  Richard, I left you a message about this issue on Tuesday.  I really need your input  before we make the payments to Lynx.  Could we meet today sometime or talk on  the phone? Thanks, 	Cynthia Hakemack 		  Julie,  I'm working with Legal and Bob Surles with Lynx Energy Company on  some pricing issues regarding meter 6677.  I have verified with Bob Fischer  in the Transport Group the transportation rates that HPLC is paying to Gulf  Coast Pipeline Company, which in turn must be paid to HPLC by Lynx Energy.    Would you please change Sitara to reflect the transportation rates shown on  the schedule below?  Also, I've recalculated the average price and need you  to make those changes too. Thanks.
