Any validity to this? Benjamin Markey A fact is this summer the NE never got very hot.  Therefore the  Great Lakes didn't heat up as much as normal.

Does the lake affect snow theory cover this or would this be the infamous Shively Windchill Effect I used to hear so much about when on Central ?? May be the reverse will happen, please enlighten me if you know something... It might be interesting to take a look at the historical water temps. of great lakes historical vs current year, may be the Enron depth of research can  investigate.
