Richard Tomaski and Lee Fasecetti are the traders for the Park and Loans.   The risk will reside in the Midwest Hub Book. Hunter     	 	 	                            	 Please let me know the names of the internal traders who will need execute  rights to the new Park & Loan transaction. Hunter, Are you going to want a separate risk book for these transactions and will we  want this set up on EOL? Thanks for your help. Stephanie x33465
