Please put a note on Geoff's desk and my calendar     	 	 	 The Electronic Commerce team is working with Marketing Operations and  Commercial in development of the GISB Capacity Release EDI datasets.  One  critical step in this process is creation of a database. I would like to schedule a quick 30 minute meeting to discuss creation of  this database and ensure all potential interfacing groups are in the loop.  * Review Objectives  * Determine best database   -   Oracle or Sybase  * Set Priority for DA's Currently, I have EB3013 scheduled for 2p.m. on Friday, July 14, 2000.   Please let me know if you are not able to attend. Thanks, dg x3-9517   -  This is not the file that will be given to DA's, but gives you a basic  idea of what we will need.      -  This test plan is in a "rough" format, but will give you an idea of  our scope.
