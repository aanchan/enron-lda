Dustin Collins Hunter - per our conversation the other day, I am finishing up my first  rotation with the LNG group and am very interested in rotating into your  Fundamentals group.  I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to  further discuss such opportunities.  Please let me know what time is good for  you. Regards, Dustin
