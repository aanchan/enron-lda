For your review, I have attached a list of individuals and the days they need  to arrive.  The first group arriving on Saturday will have the option of  playing golf or going to the spa.   They will begin their workshops on Sunday  morning and will be departing on Monday morning.   The group arriving on  Sunday will have the same option.  They will begin their workshops on Monday  morning and departing on Tuesday.   There is a Dinner on Sunday night at 8:30 for everyone to attend.  Please let me know if you will be travelling outside of these travel dates,  as well as if you are interested in Golf or the spa.   Thanks, Lynn (312) 541-1379
