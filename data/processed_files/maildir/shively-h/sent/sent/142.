Lloyd Will fyi     	 	 	 FYI.  A good paper. Christi L Nicolay Steve--Thanks.  This paper sheds alot of light on why Cal. is problematic.   Jeff, Jim S., and I talked about it today because of Kevin's desire to be  able to float his entire position against the pool and the reg. group idea  that some "penalty" or separate charge should be attributed to those that  cause the big congestion (primarily because of the Cal. problem that day of  is cheaper than day ahead due to the caps.) Steve Walton Christi,  I found this to be a very interesting paper on the California Price Spikes.   The conclusion is that price caps are infact creating part of the problem.  Steve The attached paper (which was presented to the OPUC by its author last month) provides a nice summary of some of the reasons behind the turmoil in California.
