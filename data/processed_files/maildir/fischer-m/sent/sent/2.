They are both: doomat!1 Denise Williams We will be working this weekend to coreload as many machines as we possibly  can.  Please send me your network and lotus notes password.  If we do not  have your passwords, I will reset them to password.  We will start with the  South facility, and if all goes well, proceed to the north.  Please leave  your machine logged on.  NOTE:  If you are an Expedition user, we can not  load your machine yet, as the current version of Expedition does not run  properly on Windows 2000.  A new version of Expedition will be installed on  July 8. --D
