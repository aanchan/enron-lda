I would like to see the results of that method before we just agreed to do so. James Saunders I proposed that we allocate residual costs using a documented ETS "modified  Massachusetts formula" I think Tracy was "ok" with that approach.   Rod? Jim - Has there been any determination on spreading the SAP costs to the  BUs?  We need to load the 2001 plan into SAP soon. Rod Hayslett Yes.      Let's ask Jim for a recommendation as to the method of allocation.  How do you want to allocate to the BUs the SAP costs that Company 0366  receives from Corp?
