John, I was just thinking that if this deconning becomes a routene activity  for us and PG&E, we might want to consider breaking  in a company that is  less expensive, can more quickly mobilize and get the same quality work  product.  Vector, has to travel  from Ohio.   Deconning the separators  becomes an internal  washing job of the vessel.   I will discuss this with Tiny about possibly using someone else.  Tiny, do  you think Riley would be interested in tackling this issue for us and PG&E?   As you know, they do not have a deconning permit from the EPA, but with the  new PCB rules in place, a permit is not necessary anymore to do deconning  activities.  How do you think PG&E will respond to us possibly using another  contractor other than Vector for the work.  I suppose we can bring this issue  up in Flagstaff. Mums the word on the PCB modeling issue, John.  Thanks for your guidance and  thoughts.   Larry, Good thoughts.  I believe Rod Boschee told me he was putting the same  thoughts on the agenda which cover your items 1-4.  However, I will take a  close look at his draft agenda and make certain that the equivalent thoughts  are on there.  Now, about item 5 and your closing paragraph.   Item No. 5 - I  do not want to open the issue of the "PCB Model" to PG&E at this time.  Maybe  later, but not now.  As far as your thoughts in the closing paragraph - Randy  Rice and I want the Ultimate Separators "deconned".  We took great pains last  fall (when we had the separators down) to test and decon them - so we could  establish a "base line".  Why would we take the system down and change the  filters out and test any residue without also deconning the facility?  If we  did that - then hypothetically - next fall (2002) when we took the system  down and changed the filters - if we took any wipe samples - it could contain  residue accumulated over a two year period and not just during the past  twelve months.  It seems to me that it makes much more sense to decon the  separators at the same time that we change the filters and that way we will  know exactly what has hit them sense the last time we opened them up.  I'm  open to further argument on it - but that is the way Randy and I see it at  this point in time.   On the subject of the selection of the contractor - Randy and I believe that  you and Tiny should probably select whatever consulting firm can do the best  job and is most dependable.  Remember that PG&E had confidence in Vector (at  least that is what I recall from last fall).  So, if we go with a new  consultant - will PG&E have the same confidence?  Also, you and Tiny must  make certain that the firm we use has some "acceptable" credentials.  What  PCB issues have they handled in the past, etc.   I will be glad to discuss any of this with you or Tiny as needed. Thanks, John Shafer Larry, Glad you got this audit out of the way.  I will be needing your agenda items  for our meeting with PG&E so we can send them to Rod Boschee.  Think it over  carefully, and let's have all of the items we need to discuss ready to go  over with them.  Looking forward to seeing you.  Randy and I will fly out  early on July 24 and maybe we can have some time that afternoon and all day  July 26 to see some of the facilities we had discussed before.  John Larry, Got your message and am sorry that you can not attend.  We will work with Ted  on getting you a replacement.  Good luck with your meeting.   See you next time. Don Bruce Larry, This is a very important meeting with PG&E.  I will be discussing with them  the schedule to take the ultimate separators down this fall and do some  testing.  You should be at this meeting.  John On behalf of Randy Rice: John and Randy have rescheduled their Flagstaff trip to meet with PG&E, on  Wednesday, July 25th and Thursday, July 26th if needed.  They will be flying  on Thursday, July 26th.  Sarita and I will provide their travel itinerary  once arranged. He suggests the meetings be held at the Little America Hotel in Flagstaff,AZ,  (phone no. 520-779-2741.
