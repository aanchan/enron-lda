Laguna and or Moutainair team, because I dont know which team is responsible  for the Belen delivery point, would someone check on liquids at this location  and if present, collect a sample and have it analyzed for PCB's?  We're  required to do this by the contract.  If no liquids are present, drop  Lorraine and or myself a message  stating such.  Thanx Larry - PCB testing that TW has committed to with PNM for October 1, 2001  through September 30, 2006 is the same as the commitment TW agreed to 5 yrs.  ago and that is as follows: "...PCB sampling program standards set forth by the EPA at the TW/PNM  delivery points of Rio Puerco, Ft. Wingate and Belen". Thanks for your assistance. Lorraine  sampling at pnm/wingate innerconnect has no liquids,would you let lorraine  know thanks larry. walt at the gallup team we be jammin, and you da man larry.
