Donna/Arnold  sorry about not making the conference call today.  The state of  New Mexico showed up at my office this  morning and made a surprise  inspection at one of our C/S south of Roswell.  I felt the need to tag along  with them....  Heres the way it is.  The EPA is required to address all federal concerns  when they are the lead agency is a permitting issue.  Even when it comes to  an issue like approving a turbine installation on previously disturbed  ground, they are required to ensure compliance with the Endangered Species  Act (ESA).  This is not a new issue with the EPA.  Im having the same thing  happen to me by the EPA I had called the EPA in San Francisco about the  status of the air permits for the Red Rock expansion for C/S 3 and 4.  The  permitting engineer told me that prior to issuance of the permits, their air  group would need assurances that the ESA regulations are being adressed.  I  told the engineer that becasue C/S 3 and 4 are on the reservation and that  the Navajo Nation has its own EPA group, that the ESA requirements are taken  care of by the Navajo Nation EPA.  (As you remember, the Navajo Nation  verbally told me that surveys would not be requried on the compressor station  sites for endangered plants and or animals).   I gave the EPA engineer the  Navajo Nation Fish and Wiildlife contact and he said that he would give him a  call and that he would also check this issue out with the legal attorneys  with the EPA.  Bottom line is that we are waiting for a response from EPA as  to whether surveys would be required or not.  I told him that we were  expecting the permits by the end of September and that if necessary, I would  schedule ESA surveys and circumvent this whole issue.  He advised me not to  do this.  I think his decision had something to do with  the EPA usurping  authority of the Navajos and asserting authority on Indian Lands without  Indian consent.  He said he would get back with me on this by Friday as to  whether their attorneys agreed that the jurisdiction of the EPA on Navajo  Lands when the Navajos have an environmental agency which administrates these  types of issues.  Im a little irritated that the EPA didnt notify me about this when it first  became an issue, but didnt pursue this as I didnt want to possibly  delay  issuance of the permits.  Ill send something out via email when I hear from  the EPA.   Larry -Arnold reported in the weekly meeting today that the EPA is requesting  a T&E survey at Stations 3 & 4 prior to issuing air permits.  Don't know if  you anticipate this being a problem or lengthy process, but Steve Burns sent  the following message to me (which I thought I had forwarded to you-sorry  looks like I didn't).  Any way, I don't know if he could help push the  process along or not or if the permits he is talking about are ROW only....if  so, give him a call. Yes -Stations 2, 3 & 4 are on federal land.  Station 2 is on national forest  land and Stations 3 & 4 is leased to the Navajo Nation.   Questions, let me  know.  Thanks. Donna Are any of the four compressor station upgrades on the Transwestern line on  federal lands?
