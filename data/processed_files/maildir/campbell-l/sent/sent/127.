Lorraine, Ill give you a call this afternoon.  By the way, did they test the  liquids for PCBs?  I havent heard from the Gallup team on whether they have  gone and checked for collected liquids at their I/C's.  Rick, can youcheck on  this for me? Larry - Today I met with representatives from PNM and we discussed the  information set forth below.  PNM recently tested for liquids at Rio Puerco  and found liquids, specifically C5+ and think this is coming from TW.  Please  call me to discuss.  Thanks. Lorraine We went out to our Rio Puerco interconnect and tried collecting a liquid  sample for PCB sampling, but had no liquid to collect.  So, Larry if you can let Lorraine know that we  were unsuccessful in collecting this sample I'd highly appreciate it. Thank you ! Laguna Team   /  Norm
