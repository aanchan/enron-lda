Midland Team, the Martin Co. No. 1 facility is potentially in non compliance  because there is new emissions data from the EPA which shows the units at  this facility  emit emissions which would trigger a Title V air permit.   Steve San Miguel and Stoney tried to conduct an emissions test  with a  portable analyzer but were unable to collect representative emissions data  due to the fact that the unit was in very poor mechanical shape and showed  very high emissions.  We have a couple of options.  Spend the $$$$ necessary  to bring the unit up to standards that allow a representative emissions test  to be conducted and determine whether the emissions from the units trigger  permit action or use the new EPA data and submit an air permit application.   The choice is yours.  Understand, this permit if issued, places some  recordkeeping and mechanical responsibilities on the Midland team.  Let me  know what you would like to do. Stoney, Let me know what I can do to help.  Call me on the cell   713-408-9579 Gary Stoney, whats going on with Martin1?  We are gooing to be in a crack with the  state of Texas if we dont have some data which proves we are either greater  than 100 tons of emissions on less than the 100 tons.   Give me a status Thanks  Larry
