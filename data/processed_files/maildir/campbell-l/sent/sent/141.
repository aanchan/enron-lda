Ivan,  the reason that you're having such a hard time making contact, is  because the Foundation is going through some changes in their management.  They are having a big pow-wow  this week to get things straightened out.  The  new CEO will be a person named Ron Marcoux, and I  will be speaking with him  next week.  In the interim, I have been working out some issues with the New  Mexico/Texas Director and am scheduled  to meet with the Arizona Director in  a couple of weeks.  Its pretty exciting to see the support from others in  Enron.  Based upon initial contacts with the Missoula headquarters and  regional directors, habitat conservation efforts are where the Foundation is  placing a large part of its emphasis.   Ill keep you apprised of the  partnership and how others can get involved after my discussions with the  Foundations new CEO........ His name is Ivan Hamilton. R2    Cc:     Shafer, John    Randy, about a month ago, you passed along a name to me of an employee    that had expressed an interest in developing a partnership with the    RMEF.  During the conversation with him, he was supposed to check with    his relatives for a contact name for the RMEF.  I havent heard from him    since that conversation.  Would you please help me out with his name and    telephone number.  I want to check with him and see if he is still    interested.  If not, Im going to pursue a partnership effort  through    the New Mexico and Arizona chapters of the foundation.    Thanks for your help.
