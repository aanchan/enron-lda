Laura - what does mike's schedule look like??? Steven Harris I think it would be helpful from a legal and environmental standpoint so that  everyone might better understand our resonsibilities and obligations. Thanks.  Audrey can set the meeting up for you.  Steve Louis Soldano Louis Soldano Louis Soldano Steve  Do you see any benefit for some of us (maybe Mike Terraso, Larry Campbell and  I - or some combination thereof) setting up a briefing session for you and  your staff on PCBs.  We could provide some general information and well as  Transwestern specific information/history that might make your group better  equipped to discuss matters with some of our customers - particularly PG&E  (although Jeff and Lorraine has been a quick study already). Based on Rod  Boschee's last email they may be looking for us to replace their line 300  before they entertain any increased flows. Thgts?
