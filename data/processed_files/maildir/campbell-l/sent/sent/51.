Michael, we may have to petition the teams for theri analytical  Hi Larry:  I have just received this file and I am really very grateful. Thanks for the efforts. Best Regards, Michael Please see the attached file and notes on this years pigging activites from Station 5 through Needles.  This does not include all the analyticals for this time period but should represent 90% of all pigging activites.  Filter and scrubber samples may also exist. Larry can you give a hand with this?  I thought these results were already forwarded to Penn State weeks ago and being forwarded on an ongoing basis. They have yet to receive any historical sampling data either.  Please advise.
