David: Here are some more EDR files. Ben     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Ben, As requested I have attached BPI's 2nd QTR EDR reports for your review,  comment and record.  I do not have a "Final" or accepted 3rd QTR EDR from the  EPA yet.   Respectfully Mitchell There is only one quarterly report required for Brownsville. This is the EPA  electronic data report (EDR) which we generate from the CEMS system and  submit electronically to the EPA.  Mitchell - Since you are generating the 3rd quarter reports to the EPA today,  would you please copy Ben on the submittal. Thanks. Gus 		  Gus: Do you happen to have or know where the CEMS Quarterly Report for Brownsville  may be.  Thanks! Ben 3-7998
