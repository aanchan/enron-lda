Thanks Lisa, Prayer is so powerful, and you are such a blessing to all who know you. Sandy 	Lisa Berg Carver 	   MORNING BLESSING     I asked the Lord to bless you,     As I prayed for you today.     To guide you and protect you,     As you go along your way.     His love is always with you,     His promises are true,     And when we give Him all our cares,     We know He'll see us through.     So when the road you're traveling on     Seems difficult at best,     Just remember I'm here praying     And God will do the rest.   Forward this to at least 10 people whom you   want God to bless and,   don't forget to send it back to the one who   asked God to bless you   first.
