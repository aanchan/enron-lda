Doug Miller Juan, Looking at my schedule, I could take off my days on Saturday the 21st and  Sunday the 22nd and work days on Thurs & Fri the 26 & 27.  I can't take  Monday the 23rd because there are only two of us on that night.  I would be  very happy to make this change.  Please let me know ASAP if this is  acceptable so I can make the appropriate plans. Doug
