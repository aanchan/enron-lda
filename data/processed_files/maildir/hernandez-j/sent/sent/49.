I heeded His words, and in the two boxes    Both my joys and sorrows I stored    But though the gold became heavier each day    The black was as light as before    With curiosity, I opened the black    I wanted to find out why    And I saw, in the base of the box, a hole    Which my sorrows had fallen out    I showed the hole to God, and mused aloud,    "I wonder where my sorrows could be."    He smiled a gentle smile at me."    "My child, they're all here with me."    I asked, "God, why give me the boxes,    Why the gold, and the black with the hole?"    "My child, the gold is for you to count your    blessings, The black is for you to let go."    We should consider all of our friends a  blessing.
