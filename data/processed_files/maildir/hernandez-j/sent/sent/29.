Shauncy Mathews 	 	 	 		  		  I picked YOU!!!   Has nothing to do that you are all my only friends!!!!   Really.  		      "I Picked You"     My instructions were to send this to four people that I wanted God to     bless and I picked you.         Please pass this to four people you want to be blessed as well as the     person who sent it to you. This prayer is powerful and there is     nothing attached, please do not  break this pattern; prayer is one of  =    the     best gifts we receive. There is no cost but a lot of rewards, let's     continue     to pray for one another.   God bless and  have a nice day!         "Father, I ask you to bless my friends, relatives and e-mail buddies     reading this right now.  Show them a new revelation of your love and     power.  Holy Spirit, I ask you to minister to their spirit at this  very     moment.  Where there is pain, give them your peace and mercy.  Where     there is self-doubt, release a renewed confidence through your grace,     In Jesus precious Name." Amen
