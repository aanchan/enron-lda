    	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Chantelle Villanueva HAPPY NEW YEAR 2000!   IT'S GOING TO BE A WONDERFUL YEAR!    I asked the Lord to bless you  As I prayed for you today  To guide you and protect you  As you go along your way....  His love is always with you  His promises are true,  And when we give Him all our cares  You know He will see us through  So when the road you're traveling on  Seems difficult at best  Just remember I'm here praying  And God will do the rest.  Pass this to people you want God to bless, and don't forget to  send it back to the one who ask God to bless you first.
