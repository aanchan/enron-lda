Don't be confused by friends and acquaintances, there is a difference! Because I care about you, It's national care week . . . and you get to send messages to  all your friends telling them  that you care about them and  make them feel good about themselves and if they write back . . . (just once) then that means that they care about you too. BUT, you have to send it right now!! Send it to everyone you care about and if they send it back . . .  that means they care too. but don't just send it back, send it on to everyone.. Have a nice day, and I'm glad we are friends!!!
