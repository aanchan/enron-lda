Country Doctor An old country doctor went deep into the woods to  deliver a baby. The cabin was so remote that it had no electricity. Upon  arriving, the doctor realized that the laboring mother and her five-year-old  child were the only people there. With no one else to help him, the doctor  finally instructed the child to hold a lantern so he could see to deliver  the baby. The child was happy to help, and held the lantern high while  the mother pushed. After a little while, the baby was born, and the doctor  held the newborn by the feet and spanked him on the bottom to get him to take  his first breath. With the excitement over, the doctor asked  the five-year-old for an opinion about the baby. "Hit him again," the  five-year-old said. "He shouldn't have crawled up there in the first  place!"
