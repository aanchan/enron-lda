She suddenly noticed that her mother  had several strands of white hair sticking out in contrast to her  brunette hair.    The little girl looked at her mother and inquisitively asked,  "Why are some of your hairs white, Mom?"    Her mother replied, "Well, every time you do something wrong and make me  cry  or unhappy, one of my hairs turns white."    The little girl thought about this revelation for a while and  then asked, "Momma, how come all of grandma's hairs are white?"
