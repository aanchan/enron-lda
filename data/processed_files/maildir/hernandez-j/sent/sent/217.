    	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Chantelle Villanueva Brenda Flores-Cuellar            Dear Friends,             My name is Anna Cohen and I  live in Albany New York.  My daughter   Liz recently had a baby girl named Jada.  2 months early.  Jada has many   problems with her heart and lungs and medical costs have become extremely   expensive. Jada was recently moved to a hosptial in california and the   move was very expensive. A billionaire in california has promised to give   $.05 for every  time this email is forwarded.  If you wouldn't mind   forwarding   this to everyone on your  list I would greatly appreciate it as well as   my  daughter and little  Jada.  This could save a life.  Please have a   heart and forward this.                                       Remember:  What goes around comes around.                Thank you,                                        Anna Cohen             p.s. Please Forward to everyone on your list!!!
