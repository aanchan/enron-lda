Please see the message and attachment below.   Sandy/Brenda, Please set up a meeting for us  Monday or Tuesday to go over our plan so we  can have it in place by the end of the week. Thanks, Ccg Mary Solmonson I have attached the last Inclement Weather plan updated by our team.  Please  review your specific area and update as needed.  If your area is not  reflected, such as Rates or Information and Records Management, please  develop a plan.  Be sure to check with your primary customers as to their  expectations and needs for each of these scenarios to ensure you are planning  appropriate action/coverage.  I would prefer to have this updated by 6/30 to  be ready for the long July 4th holiday.   Please coordinate your updates with Marvia.
