thank you Leslie,  Per our conversation, Confirmation Letters that have an Attachment   Annex  A-General Terms and Conditions ("GTC")... If an Enron Confirmation Letter is returned to us executed (full signature,  no changes made), but the Annex A is not attached, we do not have to see the  document.   We do have to see the Confirmation Letter if the Counterparty has made any  changes what so ever, including strike throughs or trader name changes.   If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call.  Thank you  Stephanie Enron Power Marketing, Inc x39210
