Once again it is our intention to have the $21MM count toward the Budget.   What is not firmly established is the total budget amount. We are removing  the contingency which reduces the budget but that is offset by some fuel oil  expense and F/X expense which is increasing.  Please plan for you and Laine  all settles. Richard A Lammers lets fight for the reduction in cash anyway Felipe Ospina Ok. However, I dont see a reduction from cash from operations in the models  that were sent to the lenders in August by Roberto. I dont remember either  Robert or Roberto mentioning this assumptions at that time either. Thanks. Richard A Lammers Wait for Rob and send  to shell simultaneouse with the banks Felipe Ospina I included cash from operations in the Project Cost Tab in the Consolidated  Model to match the reconciliation file that Tracee has which will be shown to  the lenders. If everyone agrees I can send to Shell so they can start  reviewing, but what Tracee told me was that she and Rob and want to sign off  first and they are still reviewing the models. Richard A Lammers hy are we excludung cash from the lender model.Did we not do this last time.I  think shell required this. We also need to put on these models that this is  Enron's latest update and send to shell simultaneaously or get shell's  approval first( which ain't going to happen quick)
