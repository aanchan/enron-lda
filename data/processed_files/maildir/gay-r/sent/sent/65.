FYI Rob Nancy informed me that you were not happy because certain provisions/deals discussed on the business side were not accurately reflected in the finance agreements, which is creating additional legal expenses.  I assume you are referring to a recent draft of the ECA in which the fall away provisions that we discussed were not accurately reflected in the agreement.  This is my fault - in the interest of trying to expedite getting the draft to the sponsors, I authorized Melissa to send the draft out without reviewing the sending to you and our lawyers make the required changes before you see the agreement.  I will no longer authorize her to send anything to the sponsors prevent this situation from occuring in the future. Sorry for the inconvenience this caused the sponsors. Mary
