terrific,thanks Rob - I just received your message about the loan extensions and Central Bank registrations. I have been working with Celso Bernardi, Rafael Rangel and Rick Hopkinson of Enron and Fabio Yamada and Irenne Yamanaka of Machado Meyer on this. Also, I am preparing sort of a "critical path" items checklist on the sub-debt that John Barquin and I are going to discuss with John Novak tomorrow at 9 a.m. After we work through it, I would be glad to forward it to you. In short and in answer to your specific question, as advised by Machado Meyer, I think that we will either be reissuing new promissory notes for all of the sub-debt with new maturity dates or entering into loan agreements between EPE and GasMat (as Borrowers) and then the respective Enron and Shell lenders to extend the maturity date to December 31, 2001 as the note from Celso below explains. Then we will just deliver request for extension letters to the Central Bank to request them to amend the registrations to reflect the new maturity date. This should all be done before the existing loans mature on December 31, 2000. Please let me know if you have any further questions for now and I will keep you apprised of any developments. Regards, Melissa FYI - Regarding Rick's note about the default interest, I have spoken to Fabio Yamada and Irenne Yamanaka of MMSO regarding what we need to do to document the extensions. Fabio says that we can have a simple loan agreement (I would assume there would be one between each Lender and the Enron/Shell borrowers) where the various parties agree to the extension. The notes would not have to be reprinted/replaced and can remain as they are. We would just send notification letters to the Central Bank requesting that the existing registrations be amended to reflect the extension. Rick Hopkinson is checking with Raquel Novais and Fabio Yamada of MMSO regarding any possible Brazilian tax issues that would arise from this transaction/extension. I will let you know when I receive that information. Regards, Melissa John I am board with the extension for sure.I do not agree with amending the notes to add the default interest provision if this will jeopardise our central Bank approval or cause other significacnt delays. Please advise as I will try to clear this with Celso tomorrowI John Novak cc: Gents - let's add this to our list to discuss on the call this evening. cc: John - What do you think? Can I go forward with this extension of the sub-debt until June 30, 2001? Dear all, I have spoken with Irene and she will get the remaining copies from Ricardo Pinto (from Machado Meyer), and Sandra Vassel. Irene has told me that the change in the dates of the certificates is due to the fact that the loans that are going to be used to repay the amounts reflected in the certificates are not going to be granted this year, but only mid next year. Therefore, the current date (12/31/2000) would be changed to June 30th, 2001. Celso, I would like to ask you to kindly confirm this understanding, since Irene has told me that you asked her to make the letters to the Central Bank notifying the date change, but she had not had more details about the matter. Finally, Melissa has asked Machado Meyer whether the current drafts of the letters to the Central Bank notifying the two assignment of credits (from Transredes to Enron and Shell, so called "Transredes Byout", and from Shell Generating to Shell Treasury) have to change due to the date change reflected in the new letters circulated below. Thank you for the attention.
