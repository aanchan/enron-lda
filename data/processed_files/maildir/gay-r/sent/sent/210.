Thanks for the update.  The sooner the better I think; it would be helpful for us to know what defaults exist as we assess the whole "consent" situation. Thanks Barbara  cc:  Rob  I forgot to ask you about this this morning: can you  please give me an  update on the status of Amendment #2 (the commitment extension).  I believe  we are waiting for an update of the attached schedule.  Thanks  Barbara
