Cliff, Did we ever produce this?  I thought we decided to wait and see if we were  going to use bonds.  If it exists, is there any reason why a potential buyer  of Cuiaba should not see it? we could provide on the OPIC loan is a requirement of the lenders to be fixed  which would be in the CTA if it was required in this instance (or the other  OPIC documents).  It could be that the only requirement was in the OPIC FOGA  which originally required us to be fixed within 12 months of funding.   However, we modified this and now we must select either a Citibank bank loan  which would be fixed prior to funding by a swap or if we issue bonds they  will be fixed rate.  Please see FOGA. Richard A Lammers Just a reminder that I need you to describe the interest rate hedging in  Rob said there are no agreements in place so we need to provide a written  description of the arrangements in lieu of the agreements. In addition we were asked to provide a copy of the Citibank offering memo for  the OPIC bonds if one exists
