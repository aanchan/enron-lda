Let's move ahead.  The details appear to be complete. Thanks.   Rob -  I discussed the issue with S&W and they agreed with our approach.  They ask  that we formalize the process.  Should the attached letter be sent to the  banks or to S&W?  Pls let me know as we need to get this issue resolved. rgds Laine Christiaan Huizer See attached for your review draft letter requesting approval from the  lenders regarding the by-pass stack damper position. Please advise soonest of  your comments. Regards, Christiaan Laine A Powell Christiaan -  I spoke with Brad and Sue of Stone and Webster about this issue.  They don't  have a problem with what we are proposing to do.  Pls work up a paper on the  issue so we can send it to the banks formally. rgds Laine As far as I'm concerned this is fine if that is the deal.  However, I would suggest that Owner obtain the Lenders' agreement to the position as it constitutes a change to the Performance Tests under the EPC Contract.  See Section 8.12(b)(ii)(D) of the Common Terms Agreement. cc:       A Laine Powell 2000) Laine, This letter could be titled "Suggested Carve Out Language for Gatwick Accord.  This is a response to your request for Language which we would want to see in order  to go ahead and execute the Gatwick Accord.  Our main issue results from our not wanting to be reposition the By-Pass Damper after we finish Combined Cycle Oil Commissioning. We structured this letter as a stand alone letter agreement so that we do not need to wait until the EOT claim is executed to sign the Gatwick Accord nor would we need to change the current language in the Gatwick Accord. rgds Steve Laine A Powell       Stephen P Stein) Brian -      What is the logic for the Gatwick carve out being in this letter? Should it be a stand alone issue?  Not upset or excited in the least just curious. rgds Laine Luciana Souza Dear Mr. Powell, Please find attached electronic copy of our letter EECC-CUI-OD-3190 signed by Mr. Doughty.
