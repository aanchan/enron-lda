Mike Are you there today??? I need to close the loop with you on directions to the Pentagon City -- repeat "Pentagon City" Metro station / shopping mall... Chuck and I agree, this is the best place to head to and park the car (6 story parking garage -- about 1/2 mile from pentagon).   From there -- take the metro over to the "Pentagon Station" which is the pentagon.... Ken
