Joe,  of course, I'll ask Cathy to set up a time for a call.  I hope all is  well.  Things are crazy here,  crazy but great. mike With all of your new responsibilities, is it possible we could set  a time to  catch up.  As I mentioned in the voice mail... is this new org change  responsible for the recent stock price runup?? :) Joe
