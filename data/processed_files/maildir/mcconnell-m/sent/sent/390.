Jim, Thank you so much for all your help on this matter.  I know how difficult  your job is day to day without items like this popping up.  I spoke with  Carol Randall and Cindy Levi, the principal of the school, and they are so  appreciative it is hard to describe it.  The school constantly talks about  Enron and hundreds of children are using the donated computers and now  printers. Thanks again and have a good holiday. Sincerely, Mike McConnell Thanks heaps for all you coordination on this, Jim.   Enjoy your turkey day,  too!    JR 		  Jenny, Just an FYI... I spoke with Carol Randal this morning the twelve printers will be delivered  to Mittlestat Elementary tomorrow. Have a nice Thanksgiving Jim Reggie, The contact at the warehouse to accept the printers is Dan Burg.  He can be  reached at 281-655-6583 The printers are located at 3AC B1 and when you are ready I have someone get  them for you. Thanks, Jim
