Ken, I had to respond.   Speaking of bitch....all of the Cornhusker fans are bitching about Stoops  not  taking the head coach position at the Cleveland Browns or any other job  that will get him out of their backyard.  By the way, Stoops just started  working on his book "OU's 7th Football National Championship"; Chapter 3, Who  are the Huskers? mike Luckily, Tom Osborn did not coach at my alma mater.  Our coach was Tom  Osborne who, by the end of his career, made OU his bitch. 		 Actually, I believe that may be correct.  I verified it in the new book by  Tom Osborn,  How OU dominated my coaching career - my only losing record in  Coaching.  It was a best seller.   m Excuse me, but I can't remember who it was who handed Oklahoma their worst  loss in history. Could it be the ............HUSKERS? 		 Huskers drool over Sooners. Huskers rule, Sooners drool. 		 Thanks for the note.   Sooners rule.  We'll find time when things settle down. m Mike I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone  again, I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we  have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday  night so I may be working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty  good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I  have to cancel. Ken PS  Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games (when I found out that two  of them were the galleryfurniture.com bowl and that one in Shreveport (I  can't remember the name of it)) I realized he is a very, very sick college  football fan.
