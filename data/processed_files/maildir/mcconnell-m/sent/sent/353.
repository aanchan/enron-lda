CP, Please call and set up a meeting time for 1 hour in Houston with Cindy  Olson.  Don will also bring others.  Please set up. Thanks, m Hey Mike, Thanks for the quick reply. My number is (314) 213-1744. cc:      Hi Mike, Hope all is well and hope that you were able to spend a little time at home over the holidays.Congrats on the Sooners season, what an exciting year with one big game to go. Are you going to Miami? Spoke with Brenda last night and she said they had a great time at the big 12 championships and are planning to go to Miami for the National Championship game. Sure wish my Horns were going, I guess we have to settle for another sunny, San Diago. I here we are having Duck(OREGON) for dinner. Good luck in Miami, I will be rooting for your Sooners (that's hard to say). Give me a call when you get a chance so we can follow up on Enron and Nexstar opportunities. Thank.  Hook-em, Don
