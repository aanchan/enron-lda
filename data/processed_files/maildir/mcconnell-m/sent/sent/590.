Pup, Howdy.   Back from the UK and Norway and am off for vacation to Boston and  area for a wedding in Chris' family at lunch today.  There will be 65 Flynns  there.  Hopefully it will be cooler.   Update for Dallas.  Golf - tee time for 4 (I didn't know if anyone else would  join us) at 1:28.  Spa - Brenda and Chris both have 1 1/2 hours massages at  1:50 pm.  If Brenda wants anything else she can call the Four Seasons but at  least they both have a spot.  I look forward to the weekend.   This is the most prepared we will have ever been for the weekend. Mike  We have a reservation and made one for you as a backup which I will cancel. Golf & massages sounds great.   1 pm on Friday for golf would be great.  I have the tickets covered. Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit cc: You are the first to be invited and there are no plans yet other than showing up.  Will you handle your own reservations? Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit cc: We definitely are planning to go to Texas - O.U.  We are considering staying at the Four Seasons at Los Colinas.  Possibly a little golf and R & R mixed in with the game.  It would be a bit out of the way.  We might go up as early as Friday morning to play golf that afternoon.  Let me know what you think. Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit cc: Sometimes we fail to stop and reflect on events which are of significance because we are so busy with our heads down accomplishing the things we strive for.  I hope you are taking a moment to reflect and enjoy the incredible accomplishments which you have achieved at such a young age. You and I are two of the luckiest people in the world and must always remember to give back what we have been so fortunate to receive. Congratulations and keep up the good work.  I am proud to call you my friend. Jonny
