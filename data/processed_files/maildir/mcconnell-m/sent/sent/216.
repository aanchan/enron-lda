I thought you would get a kick out of this. m I'm just the messenger. 		  Ken, You might point out to McConnell that there is a strong correlation between OU's football success and the price of a barrel of oil.  Talk about the best team money can buy! Also, if Mike has any friends coming from the East Coast to visit him in Oklahoma tell him to send them these directions: 1)  Head West until you smell sh_t--you have made it to Texas, 2)  Head North until you step in it--you are now in Oklahoma! Dave "There's only one Big Red" Noble cc: | | -| Ken, I had to respond. Speaking of bitch....all of the Cornhusker fans are bitching about Stoops not taking the head coach position at the Cleveland Browns or any other job that will get him out of their backyard.  By the way, Stoops just started working on his book "OU's 7th Football National Championship"; Chapter 3, Who are the Huskers? mike cc: Luckily, Tom Osborn did not coach at my alma mater.  Our coach was Tom Osborne who, by the end of his career, made OU his bitch. |        |                        | |        |                        | -|   | |   |              cc: | | -| Actually, I believe that may be correct.  I verified it in the new book by Tom Osborn,  How OU dominated my coaching career - my only losing record in Coaching.  It was a best seller. m cc: Excuse me, but I can't remember who it was who handed Oklahoma their worst loss in history. Could it be the ............HUSKERS? |        |                        | |        |                        | -|   | |   |              cc: | | -| Huskers drool over Sooners. cc: Huskers rule, Sooners drool. |        |                        | |        |                        | -|   | |   |              cc: | | -| Thanks for the note.   Sooners rule.  We'll find time when things settle down. m cc: Mike I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone again, I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday night so I may be working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I have to cancel. Ken PS  Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games (when I found out that two of them were the galleryfurniture.com bowl and that one in Shreveport (I can't remember the name of it)) I realized he is a very, very sick college football fan.
