FYI, he looks interesting. m Anuj is a great guy who worked for me then left (as they all do!) to work for  a dot com.  The business has folded and now he's looking to get back into  Enron in a structuring role.  He's a real smart guy with an MBA from Harvard  and a petroleum engineering background.  He worked for the Global Investments  group of EI before coming over to broadband.  I think he would be a dynamite  structuring guy, or could help out in the upstream side of the petroleum  business.  Do any of you have a need?  Rich 		  Rich, My resume is attached. Within North America or EES, I am interested in either: a) Structuring, or b) Risk Mgmt (Gas or Power desk) Thanx & rgds, Anuj Re-send me your c.v.  I will forward it to my contacts in North America and EES. Good luck.  Rich  - Anuj Gupta-resume.doc
