Josh Heupel,  who completed 50% of his passes last week, but was inconsistent and  off-target at times, bounced back with his usual superb showing against the Indians. Heupel completed 24 of 32 passes (75%) for 301 yards, one interception,  and three TDs. In the process, he tied former Sooner QB (now OU running backs coach) Cale Gundy's career record for TD passes with 35. It took Gundy  four years to set the record, while Heupel equaled it in only one year and two games. The Sooner special teams, which were solid but not spectacular against  UTEP, had their moments against Arkansas State. The punt return game was outstanding, as J.T. Thatcher broke Jarrail Jackson's single-game record  for punt return yardage, set last season against Missouri. Thatcher's stellar day included a 66-yard punt return for a TD and an interception from his safety spot on defense. ?
