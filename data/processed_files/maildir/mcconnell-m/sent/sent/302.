He was a gracious  host and please pass on another thank you for us. Mike McConnell  Mike and Mark- January 3rd at the Doral Resort and Spa's Blue Course (The Blue Monster).  My  future father-in-law, Tom Neville, the Tournament Director for the Genuity  Championships (formerly the Doral Ryder Open), has reserved your tee time and  should you have any problems please contact him at the tournament office  (305-477-4653 ext. 3058).
