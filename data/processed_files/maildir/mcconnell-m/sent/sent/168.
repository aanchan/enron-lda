All, I just talked with Andy Fastow and Brian Redmon.  We need to pass on him,  they really didn't recommend him as I was led to believe. Sorry, Mike Randal Maffett I met w/ him a couple weeks ago.  Good guy w/ good overall experience but  lacks any specific industry experience in crude/products/pet-chems.  I'm the  one who referred him to you and Larry.     	 	 	 All, Attached is some information on a guy that I just met with and is in  re-deployment within Enron.  He is a finance guy by training, and has closed  deals as an originator for EE&CC.  (He is not an EE&CC guy but was asked to  go over there to help as an assignment)  Andy Fastow recommended that I see  him.  I thought of your groups as a possible fit.  He is out of redeployment on Friday and if you have an interest to talk to  him I would lob in a quick call.  Mike Per our conversations.    Best Regards, Don x56282
