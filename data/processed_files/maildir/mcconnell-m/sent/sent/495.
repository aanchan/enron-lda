Please put on Jeff's and my calendar for 30 minutes. m I've forward separate e-mails to each of you initiating both my interest to  introduce myself for consideration to working within your respective groups,  but also including some commercial ideas relative to the South American  region and elsewhere.   I would ask at your convenience for confirmation of your interest, or not,  and availability for meetings during the week of Oct 16th-20 in Houston.    I am available, in the meantime, to respond to any information you need,  including clarifying any of my experience at or prior to Enron. Thank you in advance for any effort extended in my behalf.
