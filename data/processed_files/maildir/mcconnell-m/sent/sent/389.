Mark, FYI, here is the latest update on our Q4.  We are making headway and the list  shows how we intend to make up the short fall.  As I stated on my voicemail  yesterday, upon our return from the holiday,  I will be even more proactively  managing the Q4 P&L. Have a great holiday. mike Brent A Price Latest 4th Qtr. earnings outlook with changes from last week noted.  Call me  if you have any questions.
