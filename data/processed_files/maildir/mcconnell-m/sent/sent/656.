Jeff, FYI and consideration, here is another speaking oppt!  Jeff S. is the  keynote and our group has participated with Bob, Suzanne's husband, before.   This is the conference when we came out with EOL last year. mike introduction Thanks, Mike. I know you keep a packed schedule.  We'll work to accommodate it. Bob cc:       introduction Mike, I'm putting together the keynote session for Interactive Energy and wondered if you'd be available on Tuesday morning between 8-11, October 24, at the Houston Adam's Mark.  It'll give you an excuse to sleep late in your own bed! I envision a panel of the heads of e-business and technology at several major companies, including Don Paul from Chevron, John Leggate from BP Amoco, Bob Peebler from Haliburton and one or two others, to discuss a range of key issues.  Little if any advance preparation would be needed on your part. We're trying to get either or both Keith Krach from Ariba and Mark Hoffman from Commerce One to provide the opener.  If both accept, we will probably have one deliver in the morning and the other at lunch.  Or maybe we'll have a mud wrestling contest. Finally, we're much closer to Interactive Texas and wanted to see if there is anything you'd like mentioned about Enron technology initiatives during Jeff's introduction.  My wife Suzanne will be doing the intro.  She will have a wealth of broader market statistics, but you may have some milestones you'd like mentioned about EOL's progress or something else suited to this Texas business and government audience. Look forward to your reply. Thanks, Bob cc: Mike, Good to catch up with you and congratulations on a fine opener this morning. I think I heard you say that Enron currently has nine e-business ventures underway and your development cycle from concept to implementation is just 90 days. I would like to use these factoids in Jeff's introduction unless I heard you incorrectly. Kind regards, Bob Nimocks P.S. We're beginning to assemble the program for Interactive Energy 2000, Oct. 23-26, in Houston.  I will e-mail you an invitation to participate on the senior management panel Tuesday morning Oct 24th.
