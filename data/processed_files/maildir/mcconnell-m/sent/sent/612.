Pelt, We have made reservations for Fri. and Sat,  I didn't make yours but i would  move quickly.  Would you like me to set up a tee time and massages for the  girls?  I figured a 1 pm tee time?  Also what about tickets for the game  itself.  Will you have access as years gone by or does the search need to  begin? Mike You are the first to be invited and there are no plans yet other than showing up.  Will you handle your own reservations? Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit cc: We definitely are planning to go to Texas - O.U.  We are considering staying at the Four Seasons at Los Colinas.  Possibly a little golf and R & R mixed in with the game.  It would be a bit out of the way.  We might go up as early as Friday morning to play golf that afternoon.  Let me know what you think. Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit cc: Sometimes we fail to stop and reflect on events which are of significance because we are so busy with our heads down accomplishing the things we strive for.  I hope you are taking a moment to reflect and enjoy the incredible accomplishments which you have achieved at such a young age. You and I are two of the luckiest people in the world and must always remember to give back what we have been so fortunate to receive. Congratulations and keep up the good work.  I am proud to call you my friend. Jonny
