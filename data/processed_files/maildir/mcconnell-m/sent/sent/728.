Jay, I like it.   Two questions.  1. You didn't address how our investment group will work with other groups,  specifically, EEL, ENA will (may) be different than how it works (and  approves) investments with the investments from the other business groups. 2.  You still called it Steve's group.  Do you want to address the issue more  directly or leave it more ambiguous? What are your thoughts? mike What do you think about this one?
