I will be revising the Capacity Release and Agreement and the existing  Trailblazer Assignment that Huber currently has to reflect the Transaction  just completed today.   Mark,  you probably should make Huber aware of this if they are not already  so.  Thanks. 	Chris Meyer 		  As of 4:00 p.m. today, the ENA executed Precedent Agreements have been  delivered to Trailblazer.   Trailblazer still has outstanding P.A.'s , but expect delivery tomorrow.   Their current schedule is to send the filing to FERC on Friday with the  actual filing date on Monday, December 18th.  Should Trailblazer not meet  this time frame, I would suggest that the matter be taken up at higher levels  in the organization (i.e. Julie call Deb).   I'll follow-up on Monday. chris x31666
