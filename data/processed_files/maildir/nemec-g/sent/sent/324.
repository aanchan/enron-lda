Sounds like your most effective weapon is your coach.   <<Apparently after the Hawks defeatedUCONN the Iowa team went to the ESPN                Sportszone(Restaraunt/Bar). There is a                regulation half court basketball court at the ZONE. Alford was shooting 3's                and made 2 out of 4 with his sportscoat on. Some of the New Yorkers started                ribbibg Alford saying he has lost it and that he couldn't fill it up any                longer. Alford gave these fans the "look",took his coat off and proceeded to                drain 17 3's in a row(Sports Zone record). Being that it was a record Alford                had a chance to put his name up on the Hall of Fame board. They asked Alford                what name to put up and he responded "The Hawkeyes are in the house." </XMP  got this from a friend Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable Content-Disposition: inline Apparently after the Hawks defeatedUCONN the Iowa team went to the ESPN                Sportszone(Restaraunt/Bar).
