FYI. 		  The information was sent to the FPSC staff on Tuesday, March 27, 2000.  Tom did review the document prior to it being sent to the FPSC.  Gulf added a small paragraph regarding the outages experienced on our 230kV system.  We do not have access to AEC's information.  Thus, far we have seen no filings from AEC or WFEC. Russell A. Badders cc: 115/230                     03/21/2001 Please review the attached document. Mr.  Bryant and possibly Tom on your end may want to see this before it goes. I  hope to transmit this to PSC Staff Thursday March 21, 2001.   Thanks Russell (See attached file: staffissue.doc.doc)
