Follow up on Mike's voicemail. 	Michael C Bilberry 		  Gerald:  Could you advise status of this amendment. Thanks.  Thanks...  cc:  This will tie in directly to HPL.  Brian Bilderbach at Coastal is working  with someone in your shop on the connection.   cc:       The first Oenida well was logged last night, and we understand Coastal   wants to complete the well.  We will need to get a contract inked.  We  want   to flow by 1/1/01.  How soon can the contract be ready?     Regards,   Mark
