Wanted to make sure you had the latest docs.  I discussed with Barry and the  MDDQ section was not changed since this version. 	Gerald Nemec 		  Barry,  Attached are redlines of the docs with the changes we discussed  today.  Please pay special note to the Maximum Daily Deliverability Quantity  of the Confirm.  I want to discuss how this limits us and what flexibility  this section needs.  Please review and lets discuss.
