FYI 		  Gerald,  I must apologize once again.  I will try to finish this up by Monday.  I have been on course since Wednesday.  Thanks for your patience. Ann cc: Ann,  Attached is the memo AEC forward with ENA's responses redline. Please review.  When you get AEC's response completed we probably should set up a conference call to discuss and finalize.  Thanks. (See attached file: aecm.amc.ltr.enrn1.doc)
