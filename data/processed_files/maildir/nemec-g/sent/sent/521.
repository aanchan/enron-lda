Jim,  Forgot to mention in the note, that we will need the drawing for  Exhibit A to be attached to the agreement.  Thanks. Gerald Nemec I recieved the interconnect agreements (executed by Southern Union) this  morning.  Attached is the form of interconnect agreement that was executed by  Southern Union.  I will forward to Steve Schneider for execution on behalf of  HPL.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
