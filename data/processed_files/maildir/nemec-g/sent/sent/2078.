Steve,  We will probably use outside counsel that has worked with Crescendo  before to handle this from Crescendo's perspective.  I will coordinate from  ENA's perspective.  I am working with Teresa on this issue. 		  Can you review the PSA on Crescendo's behalf, or is this something Teresa  Bushman or outside counsel should review?     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 FYI I received the proposed PSA for the Wildhorse acquisition from Petrie Parkman today.  I have attached for everyone's review.  We are required to send back to TBI with proposed changes with our proposal. Mark, would you please forward to those who need to see it besides Audrey and Gerald. Thx Ken Krisa  - PSA.DOC
