Larry,  I am OK with the form and Robert's changes, except that the proper  name is Bridgeline Storage Company, LLC.  No periods after the LLC. Everything else looks fine.   	Robert D Morgan 		  I only had a few changes, see the attached red-line.   Gentlemen: enclosed is a draft application to the Louisiana Office of Conservation for authority to construct and operate pipeline facilities. Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.  The filing deadline is Dec. 29.  <<Application for Authority to Construct --Bridgeline Storage Co..DOC  - Application for Authority to Construct --Bridgeline Storage Co..DOC
