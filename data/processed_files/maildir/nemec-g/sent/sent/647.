I am going to a farewell party for Mike Vigeant tonight.  He is leaving  Enron.   Did you know Mike?  He worked in various groups and is currently in  EBS.   I am open for Sat. and Sun.  Maybe we could hook up Sat.  I will give  you a call on Saturday.  See ya. 		 Well, I've made the executive decision to bring a BIG suitcase rather than  the backpack.  So I'm planning on filling it up with lot's of shi-shi girl  things for any and all occasions.  Seriously, Saturday is crazy -- lot's of  errands.  I probably won't worry about packing until Wednesday night and then  I'm leaving the office around 1:00 on Thursday.   What are you doing this weekend?  I'm sure a few of us will get together for  drinks or something but nothing is concrete at this point.  Maybe we can hook  up somewhere.   It is getting very close to departure time.  Are you organized for your trip  yet?  I know you really only have to pack about 5 thongs and you're done.
