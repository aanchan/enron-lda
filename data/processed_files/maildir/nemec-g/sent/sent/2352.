Julie is checking with Kern and the modification to their assignment  agreement and whether they will prepare the assignments.  If I am to prepare  the assignments I will need the Transportation Service Agreement information  (volume, contract #, contract date)  for each shipper. 		 gerald, pls change the contract price to monthy index minus $ .42 US/mmbtu on  both agreements and resend.
