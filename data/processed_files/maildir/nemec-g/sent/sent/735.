Ed,  I can meet with you to discuss this.  Thursday or Friday afternoon would  work for me.  Let me know your schedule. 	Edward D Gottlob 		  I would like to set up a meeting with one of you to talk about EOL  transportation business.  Lauri and I could come by and show you what we  intend to do and some of the information we have gathered.  We will need your  help to get a GTC / contract together that will cover the business we intend  to do.  EDG
