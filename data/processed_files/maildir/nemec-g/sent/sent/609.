GT,   Looks like I will be hitting town on Saturday morning.  Eric and his wife  will be with me.   We will come by your house in the morning, probably around  10 am or so to group up.  Let me know if everything is still a go for you  this weekend.  I will probably need directions to your house again.  I don't  remember how to get there from the last time.   G 		  G, SOMETHING. TALK TO YOU LATER. GT  cc:                      05/24/2000  G,  I will be in town this weekend but my sister is getting married Saturday  so  I will be tied up until late Saturday night. Does that fit your schedule.  Also, I am now an engaged man. Heather and I are super happy but don't  worry, that does not change things buddy. I am going to need all the male  bonding I can get. Heather is going to Spring on Sunday so I have Sunday  and  Monday totally free.  Let me know  GT         GT,     How is it going brother?  Got that house finished yet?    Wanted to see  if   you   were going to be in town for the Memorial Day weekend.  I was kicking   around the   idea of doing some tubing and maybe stopping by Austion for a night to   chase   some good looking Austin women.  Drop me a line.
