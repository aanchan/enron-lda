I made the call.  I called Lisa to get her to fax me some paperwork to get my  car out of the wrecker lot. 		  We got our phone bill yesterday and there was a call to Great Britain on it. just checking to see if any of you'll did. I think you'll all were still asleep then. It was for 11 minutes for $11.00. Let me know. I need to yell at the phone scompany.   See you'll later love MOM.
