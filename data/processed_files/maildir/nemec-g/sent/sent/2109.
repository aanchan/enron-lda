Thanks for the info.  I will prepare the amendment.   	Brant Reves 		  As I reviewed the original request, I realised that I did not correctly  reference the original $15MM guaranty.  The request was for Exxon Mobil  Corporation.  Please proceed without further delay from Credit.  I apologise  for any inconvenience this may have caused. thanks brant Brant Reves Any update on status of this request? Brant Reves Hey Gerald, Please prepare an amendment to increase the existing $15MM guaranty provided  by Bridgeline Holdings to $25MM.  Enron and Texaco board members will have to  sign the amendment.  Please prepare it and forward for the appropriate Enron  signatures and then have it forwarded it to me, so that I might forward it  along to Trevor Mihalik who can in turn forward it along to Texaco for final  signature. thanks brant
