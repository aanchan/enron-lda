 Per my phone mail message. 	Marlene Hilliard 		  Gerald, I contacted Sandra Grimes and John Lopez, Manager of Logistics, of Oasis Pipe  Line Company and informed them that the contracts should remain with Enron  North America Corp.   However, they have asked for an agreement or letter to disregard the  assignment and assumption agreement effective September 1, 2000.  They would  like to have this agreement or letter ASAP.          Fax:  (713)  758-9835 I can forward the original to Oasis Pipe Line Company on Tuesday, 9/5/2000.   Let me know when the agreement or letter is ready and I will route it for  signatures, accordingly.  If it cannot be ready today, I will contact Sandra  Grimes and John Lopez and inform them that it will be ready on Tuesday,  9/5/2000. Marlene Hilliard  Marlene Hilliard The Oasis Pipeline Contracts are still being routed for signature.  However,  I received this e-mail from Stacey Neuweiler to continue business as ENA not  HPLC. Thank You. Marlene Hilliard Per Tom Martin's request, please continue business as ENA, not HPLC for  September 1,2000.  Until we know the future of Houston Pipeline, we will  continue transacting as ENA.  Thank you very much for all of your help with  this. Stacey Neuweiler 713-853-3952
