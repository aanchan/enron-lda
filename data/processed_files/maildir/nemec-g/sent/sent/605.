Richard,  I wouldn't worry about a letter.  It was a very informal  submittal.  I will let my Associate friend know.  Thanks. 	Richard B Sanders 		 We have no interest. Do you think I need to write a rejection letter? 	Gerald Nemec 		  Richard,  The attached resume is from an attorney who is a friend of an  Associate here at Enron.  I had worked with the Associate before but don't  know his friend.  I told the Associate that I wasn't sure of our hiring  needs, but that I would pass the resume along.  Barbara indicated you were  our recruiting coordinator.  So here it is.  - Resume~1.wpd
