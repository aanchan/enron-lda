Eric,  Can you prepare this assignment.  Attached is the form to use for  affiliate assignments. 	Sandi M Braband 		  Can you look into this? Thanks 		  Texas Utilities Fuel (k#012-88968-02-001) is trying to hold HPL responsible  for imbalances incurred after October 1998, but according to the contract  brief Texas Utilities Fuel  was assigned to ENA.  No one in contracts can  find the assignment paperwork.  They don't know if it was misplaced or never  done, and the counterparty was not informed of the assignment.  For our  records and Texas Utilities' would you or, since your busy with Triple Lux,  whomever in legal type up the paperwork.  Let me know what you need from me,  and I will be more than happy to get it for you.  Thanks.
