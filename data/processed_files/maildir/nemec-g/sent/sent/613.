GT, Yea, he realized that as soon as we got to San Marcos.  Can you mail it Next  Day Air also called Priority Mail?  I will pay you back next time I am in  town.  His address is:       Eric Gillaspie   1007 Bay Oaks   Houston, TX 77008 		  Gerald, I think I have Eric's wedding ring. What does he want me to do with it? GT  cc:                      05/25/2000  G,  SOMETHING. TALK TO YOU LATER.  GT   cc:                               05/24/2000                       G,     I will be in town this weekend but my sister is getting married Saturday   so   I will be tied up until late Saturday night. Does that fit your  schedule.     Also, I am now an engaged man. Heather and I are super happy but don't   worry, that does not change things buddy. I am going to need all the  male   bonding I can get. Heather is going to Spring on Sunday so I have Sunday   and   Monday totally free.     Let me know   GT               GT,       How is it going brother?  Got that house finished yet?    Wanted to  see   if    you    were going to be in town for the Memorial Day weekend.  I was kicking    around the    idea of doing some tubing and maybe stopping by Austion for a night to    chase    some good looking Austin women.  Drop me a line.
