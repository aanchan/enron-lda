Check out the attached response from Marathon concerning our revisions.  I  guess this is a new negotiation technique.  Just ignore the counterparty's  concerns.  Let's discuss this before I call Brad back.  Thanks. 		  Attached are our response and ratification agreement. BGP Brad,  Can you give me a status on where you are at with the review of the  Lease Docs for the MEGS Facilities? I forward those documents about a month back.
