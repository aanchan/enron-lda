FYI  Attached are the FERC materials we discussed earlier concerning third  party ownership of compression in interstate pipes. I will continue to research and see what might work. 		  Here are two FERC cases for your ECS files.  The certificates for Cotton  Valley Compression are on tomorrow's FERC agenda.  The forthcoming orders may  be relevant to future ECS projects.  With respect to Transwestern, the  attached orders make it clear that the FERC knows how to order what it views  as a jurisdictional entity to show cause regarding its status and, ultimately  to file for a certificate.  This is consistent with our view  of the  Transwestern order. - Randy  - COTVAL.DOC  - COTTNVAL.DOC
