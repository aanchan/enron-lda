I was thinking about coming into Austin Friday night and driving up with you  guys on Saturday and staying in Austin again Saturday night.  I am going to  have a friend with me (male unfortunately) since I have two tickets.  Let me  know if that fits in with your plans. Gerald, The bus trip has been cancelled. We are all just driving down there. Let me know what your plans are. I will talk to you later. GT  cc:  Gerald,  What's going on? What is your mailing address again? I need to mail you a  check. let me know.  gt         GT,  I was surfing on the aggie BBS during lunch and stumbled across a   post with   this picture on it. This is hilarious.   Go to this site and take a  look.       http://216.178.224.116/pages/forums/Forum2/HTML/004740.html
