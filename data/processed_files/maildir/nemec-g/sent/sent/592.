Mary,  Here is another one from Candy.  Might want to check with AEW to make  sure she hasn't taken care of this already.  Thanks for your help. 	Candace L Bywaters 		  Along the same lines as my previous request for Intratex's company  dissolution, I would like to verify the status of HPL Resources Company and,  if it is also dissolved, would request a copy of the dissolution. I am making filings to the State's Comptroller's office for payment of  suspensed moneys and the form requires this type of information and  documentation. Thanks, and would appreciate this information at your earliest convenience. Candy
