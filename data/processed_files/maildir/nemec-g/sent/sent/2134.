Hey EZ,  Paul's number is 760-510-8090.  I haven't called him yet but need  to. Yea it was good to hang out with you again this weekend.  I did look up  that Acura on the internet .  Looks interesting.  We'll have to give her a  test drive. Later, G 		  Gerald, here is a picture from a cruise we took in January...  <<9formalnight.jpg I put some more pictures on www.geocities.com/pbieraugel Later.  Paul.  - 9formalnight.jpg
