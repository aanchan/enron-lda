Is this being looked at as an ENA acquistion also, or solely a Crescendo  acquisition? 	Please respond to kckrisa 		  I received the proposed PSA for the Wildhorse acquisition from Petrie Parkman today.  I have attached for everyone's review.  We are required to send back to TBI with proposed changes with our proposal. Mark, would you please forward to those who need to see it besides Audrey and Gerald. Thx Ken Krisa  - PSA.DOC
