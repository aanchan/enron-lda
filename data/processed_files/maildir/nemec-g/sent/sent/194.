The easment was sent off for recording, but I have not recieved the recorded  copy from the county yet.  As soons as I receive it, I will forward to John. Did we record the new easement for the Bayport Celanese measurement station  project?  If so, could you get a copy of the recorded easement to John Towles  in ROW so they can file it.  Thanks!
