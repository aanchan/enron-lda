Debra,  This is another one for a Master Firm/Purchase Sale.  The Enron  entity in these deals is Bridgeline Gas Marketing, LLC Let me know if you have any questions. 		  Gerald, Here is the first credit worksheet for terms to the draft Sempra contract.   Once you prepare the draft, e-mail it to me, and I will forward it to BGML.   After that, we can get the contact and address information to formally pursue  a negotiation. thanks brant
