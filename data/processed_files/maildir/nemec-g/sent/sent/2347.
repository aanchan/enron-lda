Ken,  I have read through the agreement.  I think this agreement need some  fairly significant revisions.  It is extremely one-sided as currently  written.  I will write up my comments and get those to you early next week. 	Please respond to kckrisa 		  Gerald, Have you had a chance to look at the Compressor Rental Agreement for the Badger Wash Gas Plant? Ken Krisa
