Stop it.  You're scaring me!! 	Eric Gillaspie 		 Heinifer, A few corrections:  Jeff and Cathy call each other "boo" not "pooh".   Secondly, with your threats of my arse being kicked, I must say that violence  solves nothing, but if you wanna dance tonight, bring it on.  Third, it is  not a "supposed" conference call just because you didn't plan it or have the  idea, IT IS A GO!  Fourthly, & oh yes Fourthly is a word, anyone who wants to  can "present"  their ideas & suggestions  (or demands if your a Nazi) on the  conference call. Lastly,  I can't wait to get drunk in a foreign country with all of you. Eric Gillaspie 713-345-7667 Enron Building 3886 		  It's all fun and games until someone gets their butt kicked. I think you are mistaken me for Cathy. She's the only one I know with the name pooh bear. By the way, on this supposed conference call, who all is presenting information? Honey, come on................. it's a line from the Blues Brothers movie....................... it just jokes pooh bear! Matt you shall pay for your insubordination!  I know you and it was not an oversight or a mistake! Eric Gillaspie 713-345-7667 Enron Building 3886                     energy.com                        cc: Concord goes down. It'll be too cold and I'll complain about being cold the whole time. Plus, it's not as interesting as Spain. Matt, you could wear cute little bullfighter pants, with knee-high white socks and a sexy beret atop your noggin. The hot-blooded, salsa-dancin', dark skinned, beautiful spanish maidens will be falling all over you. You don't want frompy, belching, stinky armpit German women chasing you around, do you? Or, do you? Eric, to your little Illinois/Nazis comment below that you didn't copy me on, well...You suck! And you'll pay later for that, dear. What's the problem with Germans?  I tend to like them . . . very strong and verile people.  A handsome people.  Plus, they love to drink beer. AND, I would like to wear some of those little shorts that have suspenders attached with cute little buttons and dance a little jig with a big stein in my hand.  What is wrong with that?  cc:  |  |  --|  Just to let you all know where I stand... I'm not interested in  Germany  (even though it's my motherland).  I don't think you need VISAS for any of the Western European Nations,  just  your  passport, I'll check on that.  I don't think Jenn and I had VISAS when  we  went  to Europe in 1996 (& we went to Wanker island, Frog cental, Latin  loverland  and  Whop central).  August 12th sounds good for the conference call.  Later.

I can initiate the long  distance  portion from here as I have free long distance on my cell phone so we  could talk for an extended time period if necessary.  I get home from  Cali on Friday, August 11th . . . what do you say we plan a call for  plan  (we have a plan!) and we can all 'come' to the conference call  prepared  with whatever research regarding destination, travel plans,  accomodations, etc. we want and then duke it out over the phone until  a  firm itenerary has been established.  Do you know how much time prior to travel we need to make visa  arrangements (or are they even necessary any more)?  I think there are  certain countries now the U.S. has an agreement with to allow citizens  to pass freely back-and-forth.  ????   cc:     Concord goes down.                     That sounds good to me.  Personally, I like Germany and would be for   that if possible.   I'm ready to comit . . . if I have my current job it shouldn't be a   problem . . . if I have a new job I will just tell them that I had a   prior vacation scheduled.  No problem.  Inform me about the next  step   Master.  Buy tickets now?  Give me an assignment and I will follow   through with it.     G & J still in, too?          cc:    |    |            --|                Still flying the Concord to Europe?       Okay - I've been making continuous attempts to reach my little   London    bitch -- I've now gotten the phone number (I think) and left a   message    on it for her in London and have your Fairfield connection trying  to    reach her through United Airlines e-mail AS WELL as a pilot for   United    that is a cousin of a friend of mine who is doing the same.  No    response    yet.  Are we waiting for this?       Have there been any revelations about dates, etc.?  My company was    bought by Wells Fargo and we don't know what is happening with our    jobs.          It could have possible positive and negative impact:    (a) we may have our jobs until at least 12/31/00 . . . then I  would    still have vacation time to do whatever I want    (b) I could lose my job 9/30/00 or 12/31/00 or 3/31/01 . . . BUT  get   5    months paid severence; great for a trip to Europe I would say,    depending    on the timing    (c) I may get another job sooner because of all the "unkown" with   this    merger and not have any vacation time now at all       Here is my schedule so far that I know:       8/4-8/11 in California    9/1-9/4 in Okoboji    9/22-9/25 in Grand Marais, Minnesota       October, November, December are still good times for me . . .    depending    on what happens with the merger situation       What up?       I've been trying to get ahold of Stundins to do some work at my   house    but we keep exchanging voice messages.
