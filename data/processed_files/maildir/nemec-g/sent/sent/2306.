I'll be there at 7:00.  Barbara is planning on going, but will probably be  late.  Around 8:00.  She likely just meet us for drinks.  Is that a problem? 		  I made reservations at the Red Cat Jazz Cafe, 924 Congress between Main and Travis for 7:00 p.m. tomorrow night.  One catch...if everyone is not there by 7:15 p.m. then they will yank our reservation because they have live music and need the tables or something sketchy like that.  Anyway, see you tomorrow...oh I included a reservation for Barbara so let me know if she can't make it. cc:                      03/21/2001 11:58 Hey Gerald- Ryan's big birthday is coming up this Tuesday, March 27th...wanted to get some people together for a nice dinner downtown, around 7:00.
