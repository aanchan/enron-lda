Because I am taking a half day tommorrow.  It is on my calendar. 	Becky Spencer 		 This is a sufficient repsonse.  Hey, Dan.  You're loosing your touch!  How  come no days off?? 	Dan J Hyvl 		 It appears that I had a lot of time in the office.  Every day.  No vacation  or sick time off.  Is this a sufficient response? 	Becky Spencer 		  	 Need time for pay period ending 4-30-01.  Thanks!
