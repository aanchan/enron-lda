Charlotte,  Happy New Year!  Hope you had an enjoyable Christmas holiday season.  Can  you please let me know the status of the proposed amendment? 	Dan J Hyvl 		  Charlotte,  Please explain what you are referring to when you state that Article 12.7  was omitted by accident.  My copy of the signed agreement has 12.7.  I am  attaching the proposed Amendment for your review and comments.   I added the  Gas Daily Midpoint Price to  be used as a default index when a index was not  specified and for online transactions.  Please review and let me have your  comments,  if okay, please start the execution process and forward 2 to me  for signature by ENA.
