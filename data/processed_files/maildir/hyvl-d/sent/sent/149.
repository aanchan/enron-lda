Christian,  I believe this is covered because the language states that if the 25th is  not a  Business Day, the payment will be due the next Business Day.  Business Day is  a defined term as a day when the Federal Reserve Banks is New York are open  for business.  I cannot agree to a Customer's Business Day because it is not  a defined term and may differ from the standard definition of Business Day.   Therefore that change should not be incorporated.  Do you agree? 		  Mr. Hyvl, There was one change that you did not make that I requested.  It was difficult to tell since only a single word was bolded. APPENDIX "1"  FINANCIAL MATTERS  BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT "Buyer shall remit any amounts due on the 25th day of the Month in which Seller's statement was received.  If the due date for any payment to be made under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for such payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day." There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we sent on the following Monday.  This is probably the only holiday CPS has that your company may not have. cc: Contract with CPS                     12/15/2000 Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give you a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign off on them. Christian,      If the purchase order number will be the same for all deals under the contract, can you give me the number so that I can include it as a part of your address for Invoices.  - CITYPublicServiceSanAntonio.doc
