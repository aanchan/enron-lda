Walter,  Please print the clean copy and have it signed and forward two originals to  Gibson. 		  Dan, This looks fine, so if you would like to have your people execute it and forward it to us, we will execute and close the loop. Thanks, Tammi Attached please find a red-line and clean version of the Confidential Agreement we discussed this morning.  Please advise if the clean version is in order and I will have the Credit Group proceed with its execution and forwarding to Gibson.
