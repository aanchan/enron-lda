Paul,  Please check with your counterparty at Reliant for the full name of the  Reliant Energy entity.  Is it Reliant Energy Gas Resources Corp. or some  other name?  I am still confused about the fuel component of the volume.  We  probably need to expand on the language in the prior draft to specify the  fuel volume for the movement of the gas from the Delivery Point to  Energy and if so have we received any comments from them?  I will draft a  Transaction Agreement for the latest deal that will be similar to the prior  deal. 		 Dan, The company is Reliant Energy (wholesale trading group) at this point and the  fuel is handled the same as the 30,000/d deal that you wrote up. (See  attached)  thanks,
