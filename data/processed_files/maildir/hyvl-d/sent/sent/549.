Phil,  Please let them know that all of their proposed changes are acceptable.  Let  me know if they are going to create original and bring it down signed or do  they intend to do something else. 		  Cc: Alan M. Kilpatrick  <<FFG901_.doc Per the request of Alan Kilpatrick, I am forwarding to you Southern's comments on your proposed confidentiality agreement.  As you can see, they are almost entirely editorial and relate to the inclusion of seemingly duplicative provisions.  The one substantive point is that we do not agree to venue provisions, although we will agree in this case to Texas choice of law. Please let us know if these changes are acceptable in advance of the Thursday meeting.  - FFG901_.doc
