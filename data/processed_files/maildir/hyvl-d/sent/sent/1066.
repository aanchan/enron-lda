Forwarded for your information.  I recall talking with Gregg about this and  that we did not intend to use the GISB for anything more than one month.  I  think we agreed to let it sit.   		  Dan - here are the special provisions that were provided by EnergyUSA.  Let  me know if you need anything else. Thanks for your help. Gregg 		   <<GISB-Addenda1.doc Gregg, here are our special provisions that we would like incorporated into the Gisb Contract.  I don't believe we are interested in an Enfolio Agreement at this point, I would prefer to get the Gisb contract executed first.  Thanks for your help in this matter.  - GISB-Addenda1.doc
