Christian,  I received your email when I got back this morning.  Yes I had a great  holiday.  Hopefully yours was the same.  Our Credit group has agreed to  changing the collateral threshold from 10MM to 15MM for both parties.  Please  make that change in the contract in section 4.5 in each of the places where  10MM is located, print 2 originals of each, have them signed, and forward to  me for further handling with Enron North America Corp.   		  Mr. Hyvl, Happy New Year!  Hope you enjoyed the holidays.  Did you have a chance to see if we could raise the threshold of $10 million for a Letter of Credit? (see message below) cc: Contract with CPS                     12/15/2000 Mr. Hyvl, There was one change that you did not make that I requested.  It was difficult to tell since only a single word was bolded. APPENDIX "1"  FINANCIAL MATTERS  BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT "Buyer shall remit any amounts due on the 25th day of the Month in which Seller's statement was received.  If the due date for any payment to be made under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for such payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day." There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we sent on the following Monday.  This is probably the only holiday CPS has that your company may not have. cc: Contract with CPS                     12/15/2000 Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give you a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign off on them. Christian,      If the purchase order number will be the same for all deals under the contract, can you give me the number so that I can include it as a part of your address for Invoices.
