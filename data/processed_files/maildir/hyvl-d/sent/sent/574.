Cathy,   I have reviewed the attached form of contract.  My comments are that a  limitation of liability section similar to section 13.2 from the Duke form  should be added and that (ii) of Section X (C0) be deleted unless the company  can make the warranty relating to all gas being ultimately consumed in  Texas.  Please call if you need anything further. 		  Dan, please review the attached documents and provide your comments.  Call me if any questions (614-324-4537). Stacey K Neuweiler cc: More pipeline transportation agreements.  These do not need to be processed immediately, but I would like to have them done as soon as we can.
