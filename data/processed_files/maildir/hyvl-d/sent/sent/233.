I redid it today and it is on its way down to Amelia and Cyndie as I type  this. 	Linda S Bryan 		 Thanks Dan, As soon as you locate the document, let me know and we will be glad to  reassign the contract back to HPLC. Thanks, Linda Dan J Hyvl I think that the reassignment should be August 1, 2000 instead of August 1,  1999, however, I will confirm once I find the executed assignment.  Am still  looking.
