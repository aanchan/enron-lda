Okay. 		 Dan, How about meeting around 3pm on Wednesday afternoon?  This will give me time  to send comments to you and Les on the letter agreement/Exhibit A. Monday - Wednesday are open. 		  Dan,  We need to set up a time next week to discuss the attachment with you.  What  looks good for you?  <<XKGV01_.doc Phil, At the request of Alan Kilpatrick I am forwarding to your for your review and comment a proposed letter agreement relating to the sale of regassified LNG to SCS for use  in a potential new plant to be built in McIntosh, Georgia, together with the confirmation letter containing the terms of such sale.  The latter has been modified from the version you last reviewed to add certain additional provisions we felt necessary and to flesh out the unique force majeure provisions that we felt should apply to this transaction.    - XKGV01_.doc
