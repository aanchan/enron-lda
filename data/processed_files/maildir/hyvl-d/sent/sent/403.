Currently Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday are open.  Let me know when and  where the Meeting will be. 		  I am scheduling a meeting to discuss Processing accounting issues and would  like to have it on Tuesday, 4/10 in the afternoon or sometime Wednesday,  4/11.  It is critical that each individual identified above be able to attend  in order to address all of the issues.  Please let me know your availability  so that I may schedule a time that everyone may attend. Thanks for your assistance. Karen Gruesen ext. 36571
