I have been told by Kim and Dan that the City is currently not authorized to  trade in derivatives, but that the city council will vote on an authorizing  resolution at an April meeting. In terms of negotiation of the ISDA, we sent out a draft to them a few weeks  ago, but I have heard nothing back.  We are requiring a legal opinion on the  same form that we require other municipals to give for financial trading. Robert E. Bruce Senior Counsel Enron North America Corp.
