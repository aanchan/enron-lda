fyi 		  Mr. Hyvl, Thank you for your prompt response.  We cannot issue a purchase order until we have a fully executed contract, so it looks like I will have to take that portion out of the contract. cc: Contract with CPS                     12/15/2000 Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give you a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign off on them. Christian,      If the purchase order number will be the same for all deals under the contract, can you give me the number so that I can include it as a part of your address for Invoices.
