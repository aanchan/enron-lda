I thought that we were each faxing our signature pages.  I sent Enron's  earlier, however, I have yet to receive any signature pages from the other  entities.  Please fax to Dan Hyvl at (713) 646-3490. 		  BP's fax number is (403) 233-5655 Just to clarify, are we all putting the documents together for ourselves and faxing execution pages with originals to follow?  Or am I to wait to receive an original before executing and faxing? Michelle cc: transaction no. 1                     03/28/2001 Everyone; Attached is a revised assignment agreement which we hope you will find satisfactory. Our hope is to have this agreement signed Thursday.  Michelle's fax and counterpart execution clause should facilitate execution.  Let me know if you expect any problems with execution.
