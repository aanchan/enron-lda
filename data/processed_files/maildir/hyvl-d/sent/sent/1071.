I am unaware of any physical trading constraints relating to doing business  with a cooperative.  We have been doing business with such entities for  years.  Can he be more specific about where the restriction is concerning  financial trading for a coop. 	Stacy E Dickson 		  Do you know the answer to this? 		  Stacy,  I am trying to assess credit for a new customer, National Gas & Oil  Cooperative. I know that there are certain restrictions for financial trading  with COOPs, but I am unaware if any restrictions exist for physical gas. Can  you please let me know if there is any additional information that we need to  obtain before granting credit to this company? Thanks  Darren Vanek Risk Assessment and Control 713-853-1436
