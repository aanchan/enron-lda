		  Dan, I have not followed through with this guaranty because there is currently a  multiproduct, multientity guaranty in place for several Aquila entities.  HPL  is already included in the guarantee.  The guarantee is capped at  $115,000,000.  Just want to make sure that you are aware of why the request  was not finalized.  Is this in line with your view? Clement Cc: Diamond, Russell Clement,  Please review the attached Guaranty as I have modified same.   If acceptable  in your view, please proceed with execution.  Thank you for your patience.  << File: gty2846.doc
