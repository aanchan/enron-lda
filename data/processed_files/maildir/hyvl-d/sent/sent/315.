A GISB can be used for deals longer than a month if they are fully  interruptible.  However, we would only use the GISB for firm business If they  limit their business to one month or less which would include a 31 day  month.   The $20MM credit line represents the mark-to-market exposure of all  business that ENA would be doing with the customer so that any deal that  would tend to exceed the aggregate credit line would need to be separately  supported with additional credit documentation, i.e., a letter of credit or a  increase in the coverage under a parent guarantee. 		  Lets discuss. Phil, Thank you for your explanation of the billing process.  Your email raised some questions for us. Specifically, we do not understand your statement that the GISB is an interruptible contract for gas supply that is 30 days or less. The GISB form you mailed us is similar to GISB's which we have received from other companies.  All specifically state in the bottom disclaimer paragraph of the first page that "This Contract is intended for Interruptible transactions or Firm transactions of one month or less and may not be suitable for Firm transactions of longer than one month."  Further, in the interior of the GISB, on Exhibit A, there is a place to check whether one wants firm or interruptible. The intent of this email is to clarify.  Our interpretation is that GISBs can be for firm (which is what we would want to do), and they would be for 31 day months as well as 30 day or less. Do you agree with this? If our interpretation is correct, it is not clear why a Master Firm is needed.  Can you explain what the value add is to our doing business? [Perhaps it would be useful for a case where we wanted to cover our long term purchases for a combined cycle plant which we intended to operate every day of the year other than scheduled maintenance outages.] Lastly, in our notes from our meeting, I wrote that Enron had offered an initial $20MM credit line for Oglethorpe. When doing physical contracts either under a GISB or your Master Firm, does this amount represent a Mark to Market limit or a nominal limit? We have our people reviewing GISB, ISDA, and Master Firm as I write this. We look forward to your responses. Larry Bergen cc: Phil, One quick question we forgot to ask yesterday.  If OPC were to to place an order for physical contract for a delivery month of this summer,  when would we have to pay for this?  Would it be so many days after the end of the month in which received, etc? Would there be any cash due upon placing the order? Larry Bergen Oglethorpe Power Corporation
