Candy,  My initial reaction to the letter is that we should not commit to do a  contract for deed for the buyer.  The buyer needs to obtain financing from  another source and take us out completely; otherwise why are we doing it.   Another buyer may come along during the interim.  Let's discuss this with Ann  Elizabeth next week. 		  Pls advise me of your thoughts on the attached as I would like to move quickly while the iron is hot, so to speak. Thanks! Candy Candace L Bywaters cc: I have drafted and attached a basic offer to an adjacent land owner for a property sale.  He and I have negotiated this for some time and this is basically my final offer. Please critique this letter and advise me at your earliest convenience of the changes you would require before this is sent out. (See attached file: guzmanoffer.doc) Thanks, Dan.
