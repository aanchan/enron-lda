Where is your earnest money contract?  Isn't the information therein.  I was  not aware that we were selling a pipeline to anyone.  Please advise? 		  Candace L Bywaters cc: While I'm in the process of getting the appropriate information for Mr. Earp, one question.  Shouldn't we also have a bill of sale to accompany this document, registering the value to be paid for this property? Pls advise. Candy
