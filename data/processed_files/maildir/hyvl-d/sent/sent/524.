Brant,  EnergyOne has responded to the requested changes.  They agree to the  revision of the MAC language but threw in a money wrench by adding a warm and  fuzzy triggering event  if a party refused to provide security within 48  hours of a reasonable request therefore.  No standard is provided as to the  reason for the request.    They also deleted the original Collateral  Threshold language which was in their first draft.  Please respond to these  matters to me and to Sylvia Pollan.  	Dan J Hyvl 		  Attached is a memo of the major items in their comments to our requested  changes.  Let me know when you are ready to discuss.
