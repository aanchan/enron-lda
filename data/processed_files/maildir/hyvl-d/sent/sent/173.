Dan J Hyvl 		 Confirmations Bob,  Please review the suggested modifications to be made to the previously sent  confirmations for the above parties with regard to volumes to be processed at  the Lowry Gas Plant in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.  If you agree, please have  revised confirmations issued that would be in place of the previously sent  confirmations.
