The attached confirm has been signed and is being sent to me by federal  express.  It did not arrive on Friday so it should be here next week.  I am  sending you this in case you get a deal ticket for the deal being documented  by this confirm.  They have  also signed a master to cover this transaction.   	Dan J Hyvl 		 Mike,  I have added the language as item 4 under Other to the Transaction  Agreement.  If okay, please accept the changes, print, have signed and  forward to me for further handling.
