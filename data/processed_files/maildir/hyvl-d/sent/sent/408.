Phil DeMoes asked if we could put together a contract with these folks.  I  was going done the route of the master because he thought that they would  want to buy from us and sell to their commercial customers.  In reviewing the  attached information, they appear to be doing something more intuned to  putting the parties together.  Is this similar to the deals that Travis and  Mark Greenberg are working on and if so, should I forward to them? 		  Phil D:  ??? It was good to catch up at lunch.? I have attached the executed EES  contract in PDF format. I am also attaching an electronic copy of the Network  rules and supplier access agreement.? Call me with any questions at  713-344-2301 or e-mail me.  Thanks for your help.  ??????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ?????? ? ??????? Phil G.
