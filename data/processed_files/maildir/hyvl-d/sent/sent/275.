No, The canadian contract is only for canadian business.  I do not recall the  assignment when El Paso and the Canadian group split, however, I do no want  to allow the canadian agreement to be used for U S business.   		 No, maybe I am missing something.  Unless I am reading this incorrectly El  Paso Merchant Energy Canada Inc. assigned all assests and contracts to El  Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. effective 12/31/00, therefore assigning K#96054452  (10/1/00).  My line of thinking is that we will still have two masters for El  Paso.  Also, since the master was written to cover Canadian business wouldn't  it make this K a little broader for all transactions?  No, They are with two separate entities which each need to stay in place.  Am  I missing something? 		 So, would you advise terminating the 10/1/00 agreement effective 3/1/01?  If  the answer is yes, would we need to send out an letter advising of our  actions? Bridgette,  I would stay with the April 1, 1998 agreement.  The 10/01/00 agreement was  with the canadian el paso entity. 		  Dan, I have yet another El Paso question.  We currently have two masters with El  Paso Merchant Energy, L.P..  As you are probably aware, they have gone  through several name changes.  We need to know which master to keep  especially for EOL purposes.  Please advise.
