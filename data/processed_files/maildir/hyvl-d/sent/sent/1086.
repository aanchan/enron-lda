		  Dan - Gerald was supposed to review and initial for Steve Schneider's signature, before June 1, but he did not return my phone calls.  Please review the attached contract and call me to discuss.  I would like to get your initials so that Steve can sign ASAP.  Thanks! cc:  Attached is the document I found in Gerald's e-mail.  I hope this is  the one you need.  If not, please call me at 713-853-9282.
