Please make sure that the Purchase Order Number is communicated to all parties in writing prior to the end of the month if it is to be used.  The red line should reflect  the changes that you have  been requesting.  By copy I am requesting Janet Wallis to review the suggested changes and to communicate directly with you if she approves such changes. If she notifies you that the changes are okay, then you may print 2 originals of the clean document and have it signed by CPS and forward to Janet for signature by ENA.  Do not hesitate to call if you have any questions.   My phone number is (713) 853-6895. (See attached file: 2001-001ctr.doc)(See attached file: CPS red line 2.doc)
