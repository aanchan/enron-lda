 Normally, the bill of sale is used to transfer personal property and the  deed to transfer real property.  If we are only selling the real property, no  bill of sale is needed.   		  p.s.  we are not selling a pipeline at all.  just the fee property on which no pipelines exist.  tell me where I lost you and I'll be happy to clarify further. thanks, Dan. Candy cc: Where is your earnest money contract?  Isn't the information therein.  I was not aware that we were selling a pipeline to anyone.  Please advise?                     ep.com               cc: Sale Candace L Bywaters cc: While I'm in the process of getting the appropriate information for Mr. Earp, one question.  Shouldn't we also have a bill of sale to accompany this document, registering the value to be paid for this property? Pls advise. Candy
