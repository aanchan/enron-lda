Note that the previous contract is terminated 8/31/02 in the new agreement  and the new confirm is attached at the end of the new agreement.  Any  comments??? 		  Please allow me to review the terms of the Master before we send the draft. As long as we have the Master executed, you can do the extension. Gary the ONLY way that we can do these deals is AFTER the signing of the  Master Physical Agreement. Gary,  As I stated before, I will forward a new worksheet to Dan Hyvl for JER/BRE,  but we are NOT to enter into another transaction until the document is  executed. Seeing as JER wanted to fix a price this week, I think that it will  be difficult to get this deal completed. Please follow up with Wayne at JER.  In addition, I am forwading a worksheet for Haldor Topsoe as well. We can  NOT enter into the new transaction with additional volumes with them until  their master is signed as well.  If you have any questions please call. -Darren Dan, See attached.  << File: JER-BRE Austin Tech.xls       Diamond                                                              	 Hey Dan, Gary, Gary entered into this transation to sell this counterparty 1,000 mmbtu/d at  an Index related price with a Put option of $3.50 and a premium of 0.095.  As  I understand it, Gary will never be buying gas from his counterparty and this  is the only transaction he plans on doing with the counterparty.  If this is  the case, I would think only a Master Sales agreement would be needed instead  of a Master Purchase Sale Agreement and thus a Credit Worksheet is not  needed. Please let me know if this is not the case. Thanks Russell      << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)  	Enron North America  	 Russell, Please let Dan know you have approved this deal.  << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)   Dan J Hyvl Gary,  Credit has a hold on this deal.  As you are aware, we need a credit  worksheet before we can generate the proposed contract.  If you can get  Russell Diamond to issue a credit worksheet to me, I will be glad to start  work on the request.   Dan, Did we ever send a contract out ot these guys?  I know we discussed it but I  bet I never requested a contract.  Let me know.
