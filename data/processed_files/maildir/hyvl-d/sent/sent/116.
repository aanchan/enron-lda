Michael,  I am forwarding an email from Wade Hicks concerning an e\p mix contract  dispute.  Is this in your area and if so can you assist Wade? I do not have  any contract documents relating to this in my possession. 	W Wade Hicks 		  DAN,     THE LONG TERM CONTRACT IN WHICH WE DELIVER 10,000 BBLS\DAY OF E\P MIX      TO WESTLAKE PETROCHEMICAL  WAS CANCELLED EFFECTIVE 12/31/2000 PER      MUTUAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN WESTLAKE AND ENRON.       FOR THE LAST 4 - 5 MONTHS WESTLAKE HAS BEEN SHORT PAYING THE INVOICES      THEY DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE TO PAY IT ANYMORE SO THEY DON'T.      DO WE HAVE ANY RECOURSE TO COLLECT THIS SHORTFALL?      OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH WESTLAKE HAS ALWAYS BEEN STRAINED AT BEST.      DECEMBER, WHICH IS THE LAST DELIVERY MONTH ANYWAY.     THANKS,       WADE
