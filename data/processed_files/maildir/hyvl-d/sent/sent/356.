Grant,    Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional inquiries.  7. Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to read:  "(b) file a petition  or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in the commencement of a  proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law of the protection of  creditors, or have such petition filed against it and such proceeding remains  undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a petition is filed against the Affected  Party and the  Affected Party is actively pursuing all steps to have such  proceeding dismissed and provides the other party with reasonable  documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to be  dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an additional 30 Days to  effectuate such dismissal,"  8.  Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) -  "20 or more Gas Days" is acceptable.  13. I will change the definition of "Act" as you suggest.  21. I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first attempt  to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration by  mon-binding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue to the  satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall thereafter be resolved by the  use of binding Arbitration.  Is this an acceptable resolution?  22. We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to enter into  transactions under the contract.  Our position is that whoever answers the  trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the company.   However, we will provide the City with an initial contact list of the people  on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date the contract is  signed; however, the persons who are authorized to enter into a transaction  with the city will not be limited to the initial contact list.  Of course,  the city could always attempt to contact someone on the initial contact  list.  Will an initial contact list be acceptable?   Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above.             Dan.    		  Dan, please accept my apologies for replying so late.  I was out of town again, and am back at trying to complete 5+ days of work within 3 days. Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests.  Let me follow up with a couple of additional inquiries. 7.  Re 4.2(iv), please suggest language as you've indicated in sentence 2. Anything along the lines you've proposed likely will be agreeable. 8.  Re 4.2(v) and (vi).  How about 20 days? 13. Definition of "Act."  I suggest you refer to Article 11, sections 5 and 9 of the California Constitution, to be more specific.  Section 3 is not regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my knowledge, though I can see how the language could lead  one to cite it. 21.  In California, the concept of binding mediation is not recognized, if I have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in which I've participated.  Mediation is non-binding.  As a practical matter, it can cost almost as much in terms of time, money and effort to proceed to mediation, but the "rules of engagement" are not as tight as are found in arbitration. We avoid the rigid procedures.  I believe Enron should consider this approach at times.  Having gone through a couple, I would not recommend to my client that we would proceed any further once the mediator makes a proposal that's acceptable to the parties.  The cost of arbitration is not worth it.  That's why we in California tend to prefer mediation to arbitration. 22.  I have to insist on behalf of my client that we assemble some list. Surely, Enron can submit a list of people that will be initially approved to engage in authorized transactions.  We can do the same.  We've had an unfavorable experience with another Texas-based energy company regarding the scope of its representative's authority.  We don't want to litigate the issue of due authority.  That list would help It's not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back out of the contract, because someone arguably didn't have the authority.  There are a ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make that claim. Thanks.  Grant.   cc: Purchase/Sale Agreement    <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc   Dan:   First, I've attached the proposed resolution which authorizes the City   Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.   More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior management has   reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to present additional   changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to raise questions   about certain of its terms and conditions.   Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the end of the   exhibits.   1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of the Enfolio agreement   which   should be deleted.   2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain the words "1st   of   January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until the parties have signed the   contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the date it signs   the   contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City to proffer the   to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.   3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer) wants Enron   (Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction, as defined.   Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should be changed to "shall."   4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence: Buyer's Requested   Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to Schedule the   Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's Deficiency Default.   How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a Seller's   Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does not include a   Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason for the   omission?   5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers to "reasonable   attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys' fees." To be internally   consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable attorneys' fees."   6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement showing the   determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared. It's unclear   whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the determination   before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City should be entitled   to   receive a copy of the determination and to question it before it is   obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify, or permit the   City to exercise these rights.   7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will exist if a   bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this (under   bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one may seek   dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11 USC section   that   backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.   8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30 days" to "5 days."  The   City   is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be permitted to fail to   Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.   9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by Enron Corp.   (ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in this regard?   Please explain.   10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed to refer to "the Company"   ?   11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force majeure provision   as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if a FM event   (earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from performing with the   60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation under California   law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.   12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last sentence?  We   don't understand it.   13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is referred to?   14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add "reasonable" before   "attorneys' fees.    15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP means generally accepted   accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to Company, and   governmental generally accepted accounting principles, consistently   applied,   with respect to Customer."   16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete "two percent over".  The   City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes the 2% over prime   should not apply to it.   17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron believe the   City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is mentioned.  Also,   what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an investment grade rating?   18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed that the   opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and warranties are being   deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties" is nevertheless included   in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the City has not   undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice whenever we issue   an   opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is not ... Party."   19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add "reasonable" before   "attorneys' fees."   20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by "to the extent it has a   legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."   21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a matter of   legal   policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes. Is Enron   amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less costly in my   opinion.   22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the Agreement to include   a list of employees for Company and Customer who are authorized to trade on   behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to this section to   this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an Exhibit C.   Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are others which I   hope to receive from staff next week and which I will forward to you for   response.   Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of town after today   until Wednesday, March 7.   Sincerely,   Grant Kolling   Agreement              << File: 2001-002ctr.doc              (See attached file: 2001-002ctr.doc)             Grant,                  I have incorporated the language you provided to me in   the attached             document.  I have been informed by the Corporate Secretary's   office that             they will issue a Certificate of Incumbency showing that the   person             executing the contract for ENA is authorized to execute   contracts for ENA.             No other party signs as to form or terms, however, the   officer executing             for ENA will require that the deal person and I initial on   the line next to             his signature.  I have reviewed the proposed draft   resolution.  ENA will             accept the enacted resolution and will not require that the   City Attorney             issue an opinion.  If the attached contract is acceptable,   please print off             2 originals, have them approved, signed and forward to me   for ENA's             approval and signature.  Once the contract is fully   executed, I will return             one fully executed original to you for the City's file.   (See attached file: 0071988 RESO Enron.doc)
