Greg,  Please get with the Peoples attorney regarding the use of the attached Spot  GTC to confirm spot transactions of enovate.  The only change that I would  propose would be to change the choice of law from Texas to Illinois.  Please  let me know what enovate's preference. 	Bob Bowen 		  Attached is a spot GTC example (Export3 = confirmation; Export4 = General  Terms & Conditions)
