David I quess this whole Nelson Ferries contract thing started before me.  However,  I can't imagine that we can retract on it.  Please advise. John, I left a copy of Nelson Ferries contract with Kim Hillis.  Nelson signed this  draft and returned it to me today.  Please advise on how you would like me to  proceed with this contract. Regards, Jeanie 25/09/2000 22:02 John, Jeanie Slone and I met with Nelson on Friday to discuss the contract,  and I think that Nelson was seriously considering not signing it.  He told me  that he would get a response to me on Monday(Fred L had given him a deadline  of last Friday).  I do not have an email from Nelson or JEanie today so he  may not have gotten back to anyone.  Jeanie, could you get a copy of Nelson's  contract from Michelle or Twanda and drop it off with John?  Could you also  touch base with Fred Lagrasta and see if Nelson has made a decision?  Thanks. Hoyt John J Lavorato Can you send the contract to me.  I guess this one went out before me.
