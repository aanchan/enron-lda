I think everybody is scared of us. Mark Frevert F.Y.I.  Mark     	 	 	 Just to inform you of my thoughts if they are applicable. MFG     	 	 	 We have just completed a one week transfer of trading and e-commerce  knowledge and experiences with both Houston and London. This had been done to  better prepare for the launch of EOL Argentina. I wanted to communicate the  results as a reflection upon any future support or orientation we may deem  appropriate for our activities. The North American exchange was technically strong yet lacked any commercial  depth, experiences or strategies applicable to an emerging energy market. The  advanced nature of the North American energy market makes it very difficult  to share experiences and knowledge with Argentina due to the widely different  states of development and application of business strategies. The European exchange was well received and very much bi directional. This is  obviously as a result of being more closely aligned with our current state of  evolution and in some cases Argentina is actually ahead of Europe. In that  the Argentina energy market was designed closely in relationship to the UK  market it is logical we have more in common and can leverage off these  similar market experiences. Europe embraced the exchange even to the extent  of holding a company meeting for the presentation of the Argentina business  experience and corresponding strategy. I believe we should seek out a stronger tie to Europe in the future and  foster growth in our relationship to better support, facilitate and grow our  business.   MFG
