Please order John an ISDN line with the understanding that he would still  like to receive DSL. Kim DSL in your areas is exhausted which means SWB is not even taking any orders  for that service at this time.  We can try ordering ISDN to see if we can  arrange that service for you.  Please let us know either way if you would  like ISDN or not.  Please reply to circuit.provisioning. Thank you, Garhett
