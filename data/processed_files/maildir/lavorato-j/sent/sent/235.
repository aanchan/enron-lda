The topics for discussion include:  eNYMEX product development, TAS program review, and Sabine rate discounts.  If you have topics to add to the discussion please contact Brad Leach at 212-299-2609 or Candice Levine at 212-299-2615. Likewise, if you are not able to attend please supply us with the name of your firm's alternate representative. Thank you in advance for your continued work to improve the Natural Gas Futures Contract.  We look forward to an informative and productive discussion in August.
