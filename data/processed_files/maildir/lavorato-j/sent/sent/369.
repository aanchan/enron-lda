Liz, Let me know when they send out the web address and I will make sure that John  fills out the forms. k Well, we finally got Greg Whalley enrolled in the "Executive Impact &  Influence" seminar.  Each of you have been listed for feedback in the  "peer/other" category.  It is crucial to Greg's success in the program that  all feedback be submitted.   I'll check back with you in a couple of weeks to make sure you are in receipt  of the feedback forms. Many Thanks, Liz Taylor
