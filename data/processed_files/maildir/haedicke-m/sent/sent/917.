Please schedule.  Mark 		  I have seen a negotiation facility that I whink it would be worth showing to each of you for your consideration. I have suggested the 23rd or the 24th of April as possible dates for a demo, which would probably be via the Internet. Please let me know your availability either of those days.   The facility is one developed by Beachfire, one of the bidders on the proposal. You should have their proposal, but I will also forward several items I have received from them.   Bob
