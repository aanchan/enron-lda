Wow!  Things can change quickly.  Thanks.  Mark 		  Mark - I was cleaning out my email in anticipation of the move to microsoft outlook  from notes and found this.  Interesting. . . 	Rick Bergsieker 		 and deserves to be recognized and compensated for it. Rick     	Enron International 	 	 Guys- Dan Rogers is an absolute beast.  I am very impressed by the amount of  workload he can handle, his appreciation for commercial objectives and his  awesome attitude.  He maintains a very good balance between doing what he can  do and knowing when to delegate stuff to outside counsel; no one I've worked  with in the legal group has mastered this as well as Dan has. People usually don't hesitate to complain, thought you may want to hear some  good stuff too.  Adios, Andrew
