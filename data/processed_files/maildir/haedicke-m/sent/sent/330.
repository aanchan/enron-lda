I think we should get either you or Sara involved in this.  Gary has  requested a Houston lawyer help in establishing the business in London.  Mark 	Paul Simons 		  Gary There follows a summary of the key information required in order to be able  to estimate, under SFA capital rules, the likely regulatory capital  requirements of the proposed bond and equity trading businesses in London.   The summary has been prepared by Andy Cornfield who is our resident expert on  the SFA's capital rules. As previously discussed, EEFT - our SFA regulated agent through which we  currently propose to run this business - is subject only to very modest  regulatory capital rules since it does not take any principal positions.  Our  view, however, is that a bond and equity trading desk of the type discussed  will (sooner or later) become subject to SFA capital requirements and so it  makes sense now to estimate the likely extent of that capital. It would be very helpful at this stage if you (or someone in your group)  could provide a guestimate (based on the US model, but modified where you  think the European positions might be different) of the likely volumes and  constituent parts of these businesses: after 12 months of trading  after 24 months of trading after 36 months of trading Please contact Andy or myself if you would like to discuss this. I look  forward to hearing from you. Best regards Paul Andrew Cornfield 23/06/2000 14:20 Paul As requested. Please call to discuss. Regards Andy
