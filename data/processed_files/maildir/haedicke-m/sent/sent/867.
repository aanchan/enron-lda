Your comments 	Mark E Haedicke 		  Over the past several months, we have reviewed in detail our trading  contracts and the companies through which we conduct our trading business in  California.  In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit  and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any "  future California", we propose the following changes: 1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All  Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading  contracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a  major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to  have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best  advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator. 2.     Mandatory Master Netting Agreements For Counterparties With Multiple  Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have  multiple masters with a counterparty, a "bridge" should be put place between  the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or  more masters. from both a credit and legal point of view. 4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event --  Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts  or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes  will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity  to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv)substanially improve  Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range goal is  conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a single entity  and a single or limited number standardized agreements.
