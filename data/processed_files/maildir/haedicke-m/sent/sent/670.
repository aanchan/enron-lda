 Janice:  Would you please follow up on this with Bill McCoy.  Mark 	Peter Keohane 		  We were unable to convince Morgan Stanley's counsel to provide the Affidavit  in support of our position by the noon deadline today.  He said that although  the traders were OK, he needed to track down internal approvals over the next  few days.  Notwithstanding the deadline, it would still be extremely helpful  to our case if we received the Affidavit over the next couple of days.  We  would file the Affidavit, and deal with the judge, hopefully convincing him  to allow the Affidavit notwithstanding the deadlines he established (there is  a good likelihood he would do so).  As mentioned it would be very helpful if  we weren't the only party advocating the need for a comprehensive index  before the judge.  Accordingly, if you have any residual pressure to bear on  MS, it would be greatly appreciated. Peter.
