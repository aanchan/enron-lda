Mark:  Let's start using this right away.     Mark Haedicke     Non-competition:  Contractor covenants that it will not use for any reason  the By accepting work under this Agreement, Contractor warrants that it will  not perform any similar work for a competitor of Company.  Contractor  acknowledges its obligations under section 4 of this Agreement and, as such,  shall not accept any work in which it might divulge any information, ideas,  concepts, know-how or techniques learned or created during (collectively the  "Information") while providing the work services performed for theCompany,  including without limitation, when Contractor provides services to any  company competing with the Company.  Anytime Contractor provides  substantially similar services to a company competing with the Company, it  shall take all appropriate caution to protect the Information, use employees  that did not provide services to the Company and Contractor shall provide  written notice to the Company. 		  Michelle please put this or similar language in the new agreement. 	Mark Holsworth 		 I am uncertain what your people want but here is a first try. "By accepting work under this Agreement, Contractor warrants that it will not  perform any similar work for a competitor of Company.  Contractor  acknowledges its obligations under section 4 of this Agreement and, as such,  shall not accept any work in which it might divulge any information, ideas,  concepts, know-how or techniques learned or created during the work performed  for company."  		  Please take this comment into account when you draft up some language.   Thanks, Mark 		 I agree completely. However, we probably need to develop language that  defines an Enron competitor, as people will ask and we are considerably  broader than we used to be.
