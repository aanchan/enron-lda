Jim: I am confused.  LeBeouf wanted to represent ENA and EES and Reliant never  came up in the conversations.  We picked Brobeck and it was painful for  LeBoeuf.  I think there must be some additional facts relative to New Power. Regards, Mark 		  FYI; should we have any discussions with LeBeouf re their representation?  Jim Jim:  on the theory that it is better late than never, I attach a summary of  the Reliant/Labeouf discussions concerning their potential representation of  us in California.  It appears that Reliant did finally leave a crack open (it  was not so absolute as I had been led to understand).  Marc Kathleen E Magruder You have asked that I recount the facts surrounding my failed attempt to hire  LaBeouf Lamb to represent New Power in CA before the PUC. In late July, I contacted Chris Hilen with LaBeouf's San Francisco office to  ask if he would represent us in the Order Instituting Investigation which  arose from the summer's price spikes in San Diego.  He said he would check  with Reliant to ensure there were no conflicts.  When he returned my call,  Reliant was unwilling to permit LaBeouf to proceed on our behalf.  Because I  had been told earlier this year that Reliant would probably never be opposed  to  us anywhere but Texas in the future, I called a contact at Reliant who  referred me to Mike Jines in the general counsel's office.  Mr. Jines was  unavailable, so I left him a voicemail message.  I told him that as I  understood it, Reliant is only in the generation business in CA and not in  the retail sales of electricity as we are.  We should both be interested in  options that create better markets, lift rate caps and foment competition.   Consequently, I felt there was no conflict here.  It took Mr. Jines some days  to respond.  The intervention date was quickly approaching and needed legal  assistance, I turned to Arter Hadden.  Some time after we had made that  commitment (and after the intervention date), Mr. Jines called and suggested  that perhaps something could be worked out.  Due to the press of other  business, I did not return the call as the immediate situation had been  resolved. In October then, as we searched for a lobby firm in Sacramento, one person  who was highly recommended told us Reliant would be "extremely uncomfortable"  if she were to represent us, too.  She opted not to interview with us.  Since  the message was similar to the original message to LaBeouf, I have moved on  to find another lobbyist and have not followed up with Jines. If you would like to discuss this more, please call.
