What would you propose?  I am open to whatever makes sense.  Should we ask  him to move to Sao Paulo?     Mark 		  John Novak's expat contract expires around March 16th.  As his supervisor, I  need to tell him what we intend to do with it.  I would like to give him an  indication sooner rather than later (if we are going to renew, what will be  the term, etc.?). Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible.  ry John Novak Randy -- My ex-pat contract is expiring in a couple of months (March 16th, I  think) and I'm wondering if now is the right time to start discussing  renewal, etc.   Please let me know.  Thanks. Rgds,  John
