Wes, I am forwarding the monthly report on Legal.  It seems to be  inconsistent with the legal budget numbers in the QBRs.  Overall, it shows  Legal is slightly over budget for the year.  Could you have someone compare  the numbers and let me know if the monthly report is correct. Mark 	Kristin Armstrong 		  Mark - see attached.  Call with any questions. Thanks, Kris x3-1927
