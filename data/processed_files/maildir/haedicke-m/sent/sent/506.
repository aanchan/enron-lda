	Jeffrey A Shankman 		 We need to get joe hirl, and mark haedicke involved in this.  Thanks.  Jeff I have left Jeff and Mike a voicemail suggesting that we sign the CA and take  the lead on this.  Will advise when I hear a reply from them Clay Harris Rick, As you recall we had previously decided to have E Power be the counterparty  to BHP for formal arrangements in pursuing the terminal opportunity is Japan.  Should we reconsider this approach given the new organization. E Power  interest is in cheap fuel and not the terminal or pipelines. Please advise  and I will handle with Carey. We have a meeting in Japan with BHP on Oct 16th  to execute the CA. Clay
