Rob: Thanks.  I will ask Janette to set up a call for you, me and Peter on the  guarantees. Mark 		  Mark - I think a call among the three of us would be a good place to start.  Let me  know if you would like Deb to set up the call.  Thanks.  Lavo/Mark, although it has been a chronic problem, the seemingly inexcusable  delay at processing guarantees by Enron Corp. (both Enron Corp. and  Counterparty) seems to be getting worse of late.  It is becoming an  impediment to transacting and to our reputation in the market as the largest  and most responsive energy marketer.  As you know, our business is  essentially transacted off Enron Corp.'s credit, and procuring guarantees is  often unnecessarily difficult and time consuming.  I know that Commercial,  Credit and Legal are all frustrated by the process.  I know Bill is seeing if  there is something he can do, but I was wondering whether there was also  something you could do to speak to this issue in Houston. Peter.
