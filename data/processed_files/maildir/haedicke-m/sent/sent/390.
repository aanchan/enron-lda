	Drew Ries 		  Mark, Thanks for the help.  I have worked with Anne Koehler a number of times in  the past; however, since this is specifically Net Works and may be more of an  acquisition than an investment, I wasn't sure who to contact.  Please find  attached a brief description of the Altra Gas Pipeline Software Business,  along with CIBC's Confidentiality Agreement.  I am sure you will have changes  to the CA, as a result, I will try to identify the appropriate contact at the  bank.  You may want to give me a call and/or Tom Gros to make sure all of his  concerns are addressed. Drew x56075  - teaser.doc  - enron.doc
