Yes, thanks.  Mark 		   Mark -  Are you in the loop on this? You are clear to sign CSN with ICC-administered arbitration in Brazil. Rgds,  John Sami Arap John; I am hoping to close a PPA with CSN on Friday.  The nominal value of the deal  is approximately US$6million for a 13-month term.  I am fighting to get  ICC-administered arbitration in Brazil as a dispute resolution mechanism.   CSN insists on MAE mediation & local courts (which is unacceptable to us).   In case we reach an agreement, can I go ahead with arbitration in Brazil ?   Have you talked to Michelle Blaine or Mark Headicke yet ? Tks, Sami
