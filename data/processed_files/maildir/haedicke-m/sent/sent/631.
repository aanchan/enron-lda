Please supply David with a list of your group's  major deal initiatives should you intend to be absent from this meeting.  In  David's absence please provide me with this list should you be unable to  attend this meeting in person or not be in a position to dial in to the  meeting.  In addition, Heidi Mason will assume greater responsibility for coordinating  support resources throughout office.  All administrative staff will report to  Heidi in addition to their current direct report. The assumption of greater coordinating responsibility for David and Heidi is  designed to maximise the amount of effort each Director is expending on  direct commercial activities as well as increasing efforts to maximise  existing resources and cross-commodity deal opportunities.
