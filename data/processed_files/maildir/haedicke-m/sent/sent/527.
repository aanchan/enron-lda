Please give Michelle Cash a call or Karen Jones in Portland.     Mark 		  I received a call from Sam Wehn, who is in our California office.  He needs a  consulting contract written up for Gene Tackett, who provides public and  government affairs support to our California development activities.  Who  would handle writing up such a contract?  Please advise. Eric
