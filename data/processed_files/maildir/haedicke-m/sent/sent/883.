Sorry.  My schedule does not permit that change.  Mark 		 I am scheduled to be in New Orleans all day at a conference Tuesday, May 1,  and was planning on traveling directly to San Antonio on Weds.  Any chance we  could have the ESA QLR in San Antonio either Weds. before dinner or before  departing from SA on Friday??
