Does Rob want to meet on Oct 5?  If yes, I want to be done by 10:00.   Mark 		  Three things: I attach a copy of the memo on the federal electronic signature law that we  discussed this morning.  Mark and I will discuss with Alan his original  proposal of adding a footer to company emails and get back to the group.   Until then no footer will be added.   With respect to Paulette, I understand that each of you agree to bear your  proportionate share of her cost for the budget year 2000--although the basis  of that allocation is still to be agreed.   Finally, we agreed to discuss what projects we would like for our technology  committee to undertake.  I propose that we discuss this topic during next  Thursday's meeting--since Jim will be out of town we can have this meeting in  lieu of the regular meeting.  I think having this discussion now would be  helpful and I think the technology group would greatly benefit from the  meeting as well.  Let me know if that is acceptable to you.   Thanks. 	Nora Dobin 		  As I mentioned at our last meeting, we have been working with issues of  electronic contracts and signatures in Global Finance, especially in the  development, implementation and ongoing operations of the DealBench Internet  site.  Vinson & Elkins has been working with us on DealBench and related  e-commerce matters.  Attached for your information is a V&E memorandum on  electronic contracts and signatures under federal, Delaware, New York, Texas  and certain uniform laws.   As a postscript to the meeting minutes circulated today, Enron Corp., some of  its affiliated entities and third parties successfully are using the  DealBench site for various types of transactions.   Let me know if I can help or provide additional information on any of these  matters. Regards, NJD
