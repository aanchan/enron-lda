I have asked Dan Lyons to give you a call on this.  Mark 	Greg Johnston 		  Mark, I am trying to find a good commercial firm in or around West Palm  Beach, Florida that I can use as local counsel, if necessary, on a go-forward  basis with our Advanced Mobile Power Systems transaction.  As you are likely  months, and I wanted to have available, if possible, a firm in Florida with  which Enron is familiar and whom Enron has used before for any situations  that require specific legal advice relating to the laws of Florida.  I am  directors and officers next week and would like, if possible, to meet with  someone from such a firm or firms while I am there.  Do you know of or have a  database that identifies such a law firm(s)? Thanks Greg Johnston
