FYI 	Enron Canada General Announcement 		  "The Alberta Power Purchase Auction closed this morning, but is not final  until Alberta has decided to accept all bids and declare the Winning  Bidders.  Nonetheless, various media outlets have and will be calling to  inquire if Enron bid or was successful in bidding on any of the Plants or  Units.  I want to again confirm that under the Auction Participation  Agreements and Auction Rules we cannot discuss this matter with any third  parties including the media unless and until Alberta has declared the Winning  Bidders, and this obligation is secured by a significant Letter of Credit and  Guarantee of Enron Corp.  Accordingly, all such inquiries are to be referred  to Rob Milnthorp, Derek Davies or Peter Keohane for their handling."
