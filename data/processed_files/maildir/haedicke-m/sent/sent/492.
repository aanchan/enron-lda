Who do  we talk to in order to obtain an NDA with Enron Corp.? Please call or e-mail me if you have questions. Thanks, Mike 	Robin Hill 		 This NDA is with Enron Corp. and EBS is not permitted to bind Enron Corp.   The legal department would like for all potential clients to review our form  for execution.  If they present their own form we are happy to review it,  however there is almost always terms of their form that need to be  negotiated.  Therefore, if they review our form NDA and it is acceptable the  process is a lot quicker.   Attached is the NDA with EBS and C-Store Matrix to send to them for  execution.   Please select the "Read Only" option in order to open and  print.  Please print 2 originals for signature so each party has an original  executed NDA, or you may e-mail it to them as long as they follow up with 2  originals.  After the other party executes it, you will need to get an EBS  attorney to initial it before an EBS VP or above can execute it on our  behalf.  If you have any questions please call me and please make sure I get  an executed original back.  Thanks. Robin L.
