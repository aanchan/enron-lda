Elizabeth:  Please review this confirm.  Mark 	Christian Yoder 		  Here is a confirmation letter which we need to review and discuss.   I will  Greg Wolfe Christian: Based upon our discussion, here is the confirm I would like to attach to the  internal DASH and send to McCook as the documentation we would require from  BPA. This draft highlights changes from the Stoel Rives version which, based  upon our discussion, are appropriate. I am available to discuss any of the  nuances of the language. We are potentially looking at transacting tomorrow  afternoon and Tracy Ngo is preparing the DASH which will go to Houston today  (which requires input from you). Thanks
