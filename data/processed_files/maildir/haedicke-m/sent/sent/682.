fyi 		  FYI, Mark Haedicke from Legal informed me that there is some sort of conflict  and consequently legal concerns over hiring John Bloomer as outside  consultant.  As a contract with him would probably not be approved by Legal  we won't further pursue to hire him for our technical due diligence. Andreas
