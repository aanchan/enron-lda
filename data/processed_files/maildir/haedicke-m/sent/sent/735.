Why wouldn't Dan see Johan's number?   Mark 		  Mark, Please advise. Thanks Angela CALME HR 6-7783 With regard to Geresse, check with Mark Haedicke to see if Dan ultimately  needs to see Johan's bonus amount.  You will probably need to explain the  problem to Mark. Rick, I forwarded your email on Stromquist and forwarded to EGEP's HR Department to  communicate to his Manager.  Additionally, Janie intentionally excluded Johan  Gerrese's bonus from Dan Rogers' bonus spreadsheet because of the amount of  his bonus.  Is it all right if Dan see this?  Please advise. Thanks AKE 713-646-7783
