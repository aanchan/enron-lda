Shouldn't you and Rick do that together so as not to have confusion.  Mark 		  I have completed your written performance review and have put a signed  original copy in the mail to you.  When you get it, contact Brenda to arrange  for a time for us to talk.  After we talk, you will have to sign the original  and forward it to Dave Hill.
