FYI.  I am working on new procedures requiring a "budget" for outside counsel  on our more complex deals to improve cost control.  Mark 	Deb Korkmas 		  I have reviewed the O&M Expenses for ENA Legal for month-ended August 31,  2000, as compared to the budgeted amount for the same period.  The overall  legal budget was $4,835,184 over budget as of August 31, primarily due to  Outside Costs which went over the planned amount by $5,094,838.  The most  significant outside costs were incurred in litigation, power plant  development, legally intensive deals such as United Illuminating, and  misallocated costs for Projects Summer and California.  The Inside Costs were  under budget in the amount of $259,654. If you have any questions, please call me at extension 35448. Deb Korkmas Enron North America Corp.
