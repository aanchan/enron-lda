I just received the last catering proposal, so I am working on the cost  estimate and should have it completed this afternoon.  Attached is a proof of  the animated invitation.  Let me know what you think. Thanks.   Wanted to let you know the status on the following: Working with Ivy Bradberry (with the Image Center) on the cost & production  of the animated invitation. Should have all catering proposals by Tuesday, June 5. I will have a cost estimate and approval form prepared for you no later than  Wednesday, June 6. Questions for you: Do you have any idea how many children are expected? What was the final decision on the starting time for the program? Thanks.
