Please schedule lunch in late April.   Mark 		  Mark, it's been awhile since we visited, so I thought it would be good if Don  and I could get together for lunch sometime in the next couple of weeks.  Don  and I are available on the 21st,  28th and 30th, and April 3-5.   H. William Swanstrom Locke Liddell & Sapp LLP (713) 226-1143
