This would be analogous to every time you send me an e-mail, I forward it  directly to Drew and Maria.  How do you tactfully advise your coworkers about  corporate etiquette?  I wonder. On a substantive note, I sincerely believe the analysis MKM wants is beyond  the scope of this letter, and would have no qualms about sending it.   Jeffery Fawcett Now do you see why I didn't want to send this to Keith Petersen???  Anytime  you send anything to Omaha, the MKM cult goes into their Satan worship  chamber, they sing a few chants, and then sacrifice the good commercial  effort to the demon regulatory god.   Jeez, next time I'm gonna just send it out to the customer and ask for  forgiveness later.     	 	 	 Jeff,  do you have the information for the rate?  We would have to file a  certificate and the rate would need to be calculated in accordance with the  standard COS methodology-  I want to make sure that the rate you are planning  to quote matches what the rate derivation for the filing would be-  avoid a  potential issue-  maybe James could send us what he did- thanks  MK Keith Petersen I have not yet reviewed, this is for your information. Keith Jeffery Fawcett Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to  Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the  Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness'  consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of  the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at  designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James  Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost  estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.   I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you  have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.
