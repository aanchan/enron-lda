Brian -- TW does not agree with the changes proposed by El Paso.  If we need  to discuss this further please e-mail or call. Thanks. Susan Scott Transwestern Pipeline Company 713-853-0596 Capacity Attached is an e-mail containing revisions and additions El Paso recommends be made to SoCalGas' draft Exhibit 28 which was distributed for further comment  to parties on June 16, 2000.  This e-mail has two attachments.  The first  attachment is a revised copy of SoCalGas' table titled "Firm Pipeline Capacity into  Southern capacity on El Paso at Topock, shown in the col. "Incoming Interstate Capacity," by  replacing the incorrect figure, 2230 MMcfd (which includes capacity for delivery to SW  Gas which is not available to California on a firm basis) with the correct  figure,  2080 MMcfd; (b) delete the reference to El Paso delivery capacity to SW Gas from  the col. "Total Take-away Capacity" since this capacity is not firm capacity  available to California; (c) adjust the totals at the bottom of both cols. affected by  these changes; (d) add a new footnote to reference to the fact that shippers on El  Paso have existing firm contract rights for delivery from El Paso at Topock to  SoCalGas totaling 1466 MMcfd which exceeds SoCalGas' take-away capacity at Topock and clearly creates a "mismatch"; and (c) add reference in footnote (2) to the physical capacity of Kern/Mojave at the interconnection with SoCalGas at Wheeler Ridge South, which is in excess of 680 MMcfd even though the metering is currently set to 500 MMcfd.   The second attachment contains two schematics intended to supplement SoCalGas' draft map of receipt points and interconnections.  These schematics more accurately reflect the actual  physical interconnections at Topock and Hector Ridge and correct both the inaccurate impression that the interconnect with  El Paso at Topock consists of several separate pipelines with no cross over, and that inaccurate impression that  several interconnections may exist between pipelines at Hector Road .   El Paso understands and acknowledges that there are a number of possible responses to Administrative Law Judge Biren's request for a late filed exhibit concerning "mismatches" and pipeline capacity upstream and downstream from SoCalGas receipt points.  In the spirit of compromise, El Paso  will not oppose  SoCalGas filing an exhibit as proposed 6/16/00 provided it is revised to reflect the  changes and additions El Paso has proposed in this e-mail.
