Okay, I'm dying to know...What was wrong with the car?   Along those same lines, did you get them to bring the car to you here or do  you have to go get it.  (Don't forget I need to get your parking pass to you.) As for the home vs. theater viewing...I seem to be more of a home-body these  days as well. Ted Noble Hey, My car actually works.  Can you believe it.  Now I can take you to movies and  we can actually watch them but somehow I think watching a movie at home is  just a tad more fun. Susan M Scott Evidently, in order for us to actually watch a movie we have to physically go  to the theatre.  Somehow we keep missing that critical step in the home  viewing experience...namely the viewing.
