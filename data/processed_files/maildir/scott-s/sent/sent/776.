You are the best.  I sit on 32 now, 2376c to be exact.  When you hit the top  of the stairs hang a left then turn left at the next possible opening.  I'll  flag you down.  However, I would be more than happy to come down and pick up  the check.  Just let me know what works best for you. Homer Lin Where you sit now?  I have your paychecks. I will deliver. Homer
