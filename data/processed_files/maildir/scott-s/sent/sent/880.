Hi Susan.  Hope you're feeling okay today. There was a gas daily deal that didn't pull in yesterday.  I thought that it  would come in with today's data (thinking it got booked late or something)   but it didn't.  Could you look into it and let me know where it is. Thanks, Carrie Deal Info:  (amazingly...this is the only one)  140746      Clinton Energy Management Services, Inc.
