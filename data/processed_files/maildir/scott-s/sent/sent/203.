Since the market affiliate rule looks at business units rather than the  function within the business unit (or any firewalls that are set up), since  he works for ECT I have to say I would be uncomfortable putting him on the  distribution list.  I know that he has access to the same info, but to give  him access to our work product is probably a violation of the rule.   I am out of town, but if you have any questions please e-mail or leave me a  voice mail, and I will reply after my hearing today.     	 	 	 Since he works for the same group that does our VAR calculation he should  already have our positions, go ahead and send him the book, unless Susan  Scott has a problem.  Susan, let us know if you have a problem. Dan Debbie Moseley Dan, Jan has suggested that Eugenio Perez is setup on distribution for the book.   I'm not sure about putting him on the distribution since is a ECTN employee.   However, according to Jan he works in the group that provides ET&S with the  VAR calculation.  What do you think or should Susan Scot have final say. Let me know. Debbie Jan Johnson He works for Sally Beck.  Her group does VAR for all of Enron, so in that  function he is Global.  He doesn't share any of the information he collects  on the business units with any of the trading or commercial people, to ensure  we have no market affiliate problems.  Is that enough protection or will we  need to do more to separate him? Jan Debbie Moseley Jan, who does Eugenio Perez work for?  When I typed in his name, it indicated  he was with ECT.   Thanks, Debbie
