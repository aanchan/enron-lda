Brian:  because of the travel time involved, TW would prefer to reverse the  schedule on May 24 (i.e., retail first, capacity second) -- if no one has any  objections/conflicts. I have scheduled two days of panel practice cross-examination for those  testifying to the Comprehensive Settlement in the GIR/NGS proceeding.? The  first, scheduled for May 24, will be held in the Sutter Room A&B of the  Hilton Hotel (on O'Farrell) in SFO.? The session is scheduled to go from  same room at the Hilton immediately following the PHC that is scheduled for  I am soliciting feedback from you on how we utilize our time most  efficiently.? As of today, we have 11 witnesses sponsoring testimony.? Given  that the majority of testimony is related to capacity matters, I'd like to  suggest we bifurcate the sessions, devoting May 24 from the hours of  retail matters.  I would also like to suggest that parties work with their respective  witnesses prior to the panel hearings.? We should concentrate on nailing down  the substance of our arguments prior to the 24th and then work to reach  alignment between the various witnesses over the two day practice sessions.?  After reviewing the draft testimony's over the last few days, I think we are  going to be in an excellent position to persuasively argue that the  Comprehensive Settlement resolves all of the Commission's most promising  options.
