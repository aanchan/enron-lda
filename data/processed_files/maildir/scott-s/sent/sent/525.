Thanks Carrie.   I went ahead and made the counterparty name change so that it will be  properly reflected next month. Susan Susan, I believe deal NK7690 is a Duke deal, and not EL Paso.  At least that is what  TAGG shows.  Would you please update your sheet to reflect the change for  next month.   Thanks so much, Carrie 58465 Beatrice Reyna Let me know if any of the deals values in the attached file are incorrect. Thanks,  Susan
