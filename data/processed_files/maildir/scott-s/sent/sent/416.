I'm dialling in from home -- got the bug that's going around the office.   I'll call you in a few... Frazier King Are you back at work?? Heard you were sick. Susan Scott Frazier tells me he's available.  How about 11:45 at Little Pappasito's on  Date, time, and either of those places are fine with me, subject to Frazier's availability.  This would be a good opportunity to discuss topics for the luncheons, which Frazier and I have been trying to do for a while. I also need to share with you some conversations I've been having with folks at EBA in DC and proposals they are pushing at the Houston chapter. International                                          Conference I am free for lunch on 12/4.  I'll see if Frazier's available. Why don't we choose a venue somewhere between Duke and downtown. cc: Sounds like an excellent idea.  Does lunch on Monday, December 4th work for your schedules?  If not, let's hear a counter-offer. cc: International Conference Does anyone know this person or his organization?  Is this something our membership might be interested in?  Frankly I have been too busy to think about this -- if you have any comments let's talk. Susan Scott 713-853-0596 cc: About three weeks ago, I inquired about EBA's  interest in organizing a concurrent session at the upcoming IAEE (International  Association for Energy Economics) conference in Houston (April  2001). Since I did not hear back from you, I assume that  EBA was not interested. It would help us a lot in our future planning  if you could perhaps help me with your reasoning.  Did we approach you  too late (given the Dec 4 deadline)?   We required all participants to pay registration fees, was that an issue?   We couldn't guarantee you a slot even if you proposed a session, was that an  issue? Thanks in advance for your response. S.
