Denise -- can you order this for me? Let me know if you need any info. I'll need the laptop plus 2 docking stations, one upstairs and one down. And a normal monitor & keyboard. Jeff Nguyen Susan, I've spoke to our purchasing person, Karon O'gorman, about an order status in  Omaha.  According to Karon, all purchasing from Omaha and Houston goes  through her.  Therefore, if you need to order a new laptop, Karon can handle  all of the arrangements for you. Thanks, Jeff Nguyen
