First of all, this is a brand-new contract, not a modification of one that  used to be IT. It's for LFT space that we have posted according to our usual procedure.  A  receipt point has now been specified:  Bloomfield Compressor.  Our tariff  allows us to cancel LFT up to 10 days a month, but it also provides that the  parties can agree that the number of days can be fewer, so Sempra negotiated  us down to only one day.  TK worked with Darrell Schoolcraft on this and they  determined this would be acceptable from an operational standpoint.   Scheduling will happen pursuant to the LFT priority set forth in our tariff. I left a message for you just now; call when you have a minute. Drew Fossum Susan, MKM's got some good questions about this.  I'm still nervous as a cat  know about the scheduling priority and how it has changed now that this is an  LFT deal.  DF  Mary Kay Miller We really do need to understand the scheduling of this,  if alternates  haven't been scheduled, IT are and now an LFT---  seems a little  questionable, so we need to understand the answer.  Also without knowing the  receipt point how do we know the deal can be done as LFT??  MK Mary Darveaux I forgot to add that this is an LFT. Mary Darveaux Alas- a negotiated Rate Filing with a few days notice!!!!
