Mike -- Thanks for the input...we stewed over this for a while but decided to  respond (as briefly as possible) rather than give Norm a chance to whine to  the judge that we were being uncooperative in this somewhat unusual exhibit  drafting process.  Jeff's answer is consistent with what will appear in the  exhibit (and from what one can find out about TW in numerous of our FERC  filings, for that matter).  If Norm tries somehow to make Jeff's response  part of the record you can bet I will object...if it's not on the record  already, or on the face of this one late-filed exhibit, it should not be  allowed into the record.   Apparently Norm has also called Rich Hall with annoying questions. I don't plan to respond if he contacts us with any follow-up, but will let  you know if he does. SS Susan:  Good response.  Be advised that Norm is a little out of order asking discovery questions like this after the record is closed.  You are not obligated to respond to him under these circumstances.  He is still trying to buttress his apparent belief that the EPNG and TW capacity to the California border is completely fungible and can be delivered to either SoCal or PG&E without any limitations.  Please let me know if he tries this again.  Thanks, Mike This message and any attachments are intended for the individual or entity named above.
