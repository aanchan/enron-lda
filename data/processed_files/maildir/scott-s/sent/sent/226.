Amazing that TW has not one but TWO people doing this job. Your tree-saving efforts are admirable. Kevin Hyatt See, all you have to do is ask     	Enron Energy Services 	 	 Glen, Please see Kevin's note below.  I agree that we should keep separate  distribution lists for Transwestern.  I have had other requests like  Kevin's.  As a temporary and imperfect solution, I have marked the labels  either All Holders or Filings.   Dennis Lee is currently working to put  Northern and Transwestern mailing lists on the PLE system.  He indicated that  the process should be ready by the middle of July.  Perhaps we need to  consider separating the Transwestern list at that time as we do  Northern's. Naomi Kevin Hyatt Hi Naomi,  my name is Kevin Hyatt.  I am the marketing director in Houston for  Transwestern Pipeline.  I have a favor to ask of you: could you possibly send  me only those tariff page copies slated for "insertion" into our tariff books  and not the pages that are "submitted for filing"?   My reason is this: by the time the "submitted for filing" pages get to me,  it's too late for me to make any changes to them (not that I would anyway)  and they just get tossed out when the final pages are approved and printed. If keeping up with a separate distribution list is not feasible I  understand.  However, I wonder how many other folks feel the same way as I  do?  If the number of people is significant, then there is the potential to  save a lot of time, effort, and money by reducing the copying, printing, and  distribution costs. Let me know what you think. thanks Kevin Hyatt 713-853-5559
