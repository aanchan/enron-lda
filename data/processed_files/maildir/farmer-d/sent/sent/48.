This has been corrected.  A transport usage ticket should have been used,  instead of a desk to desk. D     	Enron Capital Management 	 	     	 	 	 Transport Book has never bought or sold before.  Should this be changed to  HPLC - Operational or do we need to set up a new desk for HPLC Transport.   Right now, the buy side is not recorded anywhere. SRM (x33548)
