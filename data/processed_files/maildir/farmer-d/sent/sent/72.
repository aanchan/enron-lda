JM,  Can you extend the contrtact on deal 138605 thru 10/2/00 ? D Daren, I have some flow at the above referenced meter without a deal.  Flow was for  the first 2 days only, and probably occured as the meter was in the process  of being shut in.  We purchased the gas from Torch-Rally Partnership in  Sept.  Can you extend the deal, or should I allocated off to strangers? Please advise. Mary
