I changed the pricing on deal 157288 for the East Texas point. D Daren- Have you had a chance to change the pricing in the system?  Duke has called me several times they want to get our March deals finalized. I am not sure what I should tell them.   Thanks- Katherine Herrera Deal # 157288 Per our conversation yesterday afternoon, pls. separate the Centena term deal  from the spot deal in Sitara for March 2000 production.   Also, I need to have the price for the East Texas redelivery changed in  Sitara from HS Index $-.085 to HS Index $-.0825.  This is per the contract  the price for this redelivery point.  Thanks Katherine 5-8643
