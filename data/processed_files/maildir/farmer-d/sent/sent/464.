Ami,  Please attend this. D Tricia Bowen I wanted to let you know about this meeting in case you wanted any of your  schedulers to attend. Thanks Tricia Tricia Bowen If you currently have any Kerr McGee production on your pipe, please plan to  attend the meeting today in room 30C1 at 1:30.     This should be a very quick meeting.  We will be discussing everyone's roles  and responsibilities in maintaining the Kerr McGee tickets in Sitara. I realize we are dealing with numerous cuts and renoms during the day, but if  at all possible, please try to attend.  We need to clarify some issue  immediately to avoid confusion in the future. Thanks Tricia 3-4222
