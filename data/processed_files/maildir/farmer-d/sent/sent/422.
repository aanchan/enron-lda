Done Jackie Young Daren, Per Victoria Versen, you can roll deal 166888 forward for one day to cover  the 14 decatherms that flowed on the 15th. Thanks -Jackie- 3-9497 Daren J Farmer jACKIE,  You need to talk to the East desk to see if they were allocated this extra  gas on the 14th and 15th.  If they were, we can change the deal.  If not, the  pipes will need to balance out during the next flow day. D Jackie Young Can you please extend sitara deal ticket 16888 to the 15th?  14 dec. flowed  on this day. Thanks -Jackie-
