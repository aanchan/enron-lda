You may want to come to this meeting.  When we met with Bob Hall the other  dayon OA, I mentioned that you and I should probably be included in the  monthly meeting so that we would have an idea of any problems that were  occurring each month.  If you have something else going on, don't worry about  being there.  I'll relay the info to you. D     	Enron Capital Management 	 	 We will have our monthly OA review tomorrow at 10 am with Steve Jackson.  I  will let you know the conference room soon. Dave
