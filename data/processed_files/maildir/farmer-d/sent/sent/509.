Should the entire volume be moved over to ICC now?  Currently on deal 131478  (ICC), 10,000 is being sold at 2.84.  The sale on the TXU ticket has been  zeroed out on the deal line, but needs to be reallocated in Vol Mgmt.  If I  need to move the additional 25,000 to ICC, I will.  But, I want to make sure  that is what we need to do. D Julie Meyers Could you please setup a spot deal for October under ICC Energy Corp.  I  would just copy the TXU deal below.  I believe the pricing is the same. Julie Julie Meyers Was the gas allocated wrong? Julie Tina Valadez Could you set up the deal for ICC Energy Corp for 10/99 production?  The gas  was originally billed to TXU Fuel Company.  If you have any questions, please  let me know. Thank You, Tina Valadez Kristen J Hanson Joanie H Ngo Hi Kris, This issue is still open.  Please let Howard know.  Thank you. Joanie H Ngo Howard, Please forward to the appropriate v.m. person in your group.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for your help. Joanie x36574
