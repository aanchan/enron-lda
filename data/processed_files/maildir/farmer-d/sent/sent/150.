Marlene,  Stacey put the contracts in intercompany mail before I got this notice.   Sorry.  Send them to us again and we will get them signed and returned  quickly. D Marlene Hilliard Just a note, that the assignment and assumption agreement does not need to be  executed, but the amendments still need to be executed and returned to me. Marlene Hilliard Marlene Hilliard Daren, This is true.  I did not learn of this until Friday September 1, 2000.   However, I still need to have the Oasis Contracts returned to me. Please return them in interoffice mail. Thanks so much. Marlene D. Hilliard Daren J Farmer Marlene,  After discussions with the desk, we have decided to keep the Oasis contracts  under ENA.  So, we don't need to sign the contracts you sent earlier.  Let me  know if you have any questions. D Marlene Hilliard I need to know the status of these contracts I forwarded to you on August 23,  2000 and August 25, 2000. Marlene Hilliard
