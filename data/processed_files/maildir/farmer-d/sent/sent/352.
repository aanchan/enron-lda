yes Jackie Young Daren, The above mentioned meter is on stranger's for the entire month of Jan.  2000.  There is a deal ticket applicable to this meter from Jan. 21st thru  the 31st.  Is it o.k. for Volume Management to apply volumes from the 21st  thru the 31st to the 215? I don't know what kind of issues was associated with this deal. Thanks -Jackie- 	Anita Luong 	 Jackie, any luck on the issue w/ the gas allocated to "stranger's gas" at  this meter..........     	 	 	 Anita, have you found out any further information about this meter.  Encina  still beleives that we owe them for this gas. Thanks, Stephanie (3-6004)  	Anita Luong 	 Jackie, I see that the gas at this meter is allocated to "stranger's" in POPS.    Stephanie Gomes in Settlement thinks that this could be Encina's gas.  I see  in Sitara that deal 152638 is only valid from the 21st - 31st.   Can you  please take a look.   Thanks     	 	 	 Hey Anita, For meter # 0986725, 1/00 production, I am showing per meter statement that  41,671mmbtu flowed.  Is that gas really Encina's.  Has the volume just not  been allocated yet.  Could you let me know  what the deal is on the meter. Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )
