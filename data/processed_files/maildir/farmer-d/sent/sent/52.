The notice should be given on Monday, the 20th  by 5:00 pm. D     	 	 	 Can you help me out on this Darren?   MJJ Mary Jo, Thanks for the update.  Regarding the notice provision of 6 business days prior to the close of business on the last business day of the month prior to selected month,  does that mean we need to give you notice for December assuming the 23rd and 24th are holidays?
