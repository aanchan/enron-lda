Pat,  You should have been included on this.  I probably won't go to these meetings  since I won't be dealing with Unify much in the future.  I don't mind going  with you for the first couple of times if you need me to, though. D Heather Choate   Please plan to attend a meeting to discuss Logistics Unify Issues and  Priorities  on a Bi-Monthly basis...   Every 2nd and 4th Tuesday of the Month  Beginning, Tuesday, January 11, 2000  at 2pm in EB3013    If at any time you are unable to attend, please call Heather Choate at  x33278.
