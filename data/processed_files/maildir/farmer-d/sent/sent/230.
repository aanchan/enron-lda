Deal 312610 purchase at Centana Deal 312613 Sale at Rusk. D Daren- Deal #157288 Location: Centana Days:  3/11-3/31 (gas is not a part of the exchange agreement).   I need to have the spot deal placed on a different deal ticket than the  exchange deal (#157288). Will you break out this spot deal separately? Thanks for fixing the price for the ETXG gas system in March. Katherine 5-8643 I changed the pricing on deal 157288 for the East Texas point. D Daren- Have you had a chance to change the pricing in the system?  Duke has called me several times they want to get our March deals finalized. I am not sure what I should tell them.   Thanks- Katherine Herrera Deal # 157288 Per our conversation yesterday afternoon, pls. separate the Centena term deal  from the spot deal in Sitara for March 2000 production.   Also, I need to have the price for the East Texas redelivery changed in  Sitara from HS Index $-.085 to HS Index $-.0825.  This is per the contract  the price for this redelivery point.  Thanks Katherine 5-8643
