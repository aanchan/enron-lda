This relates to the message on missing deals. Julie Meyers Heads up on this.  They will be putting in a firm ticket starting in January. I have explained what a problem this causes your group, and we are working on  a solution.  Unfortanuately, this whole thing was missed, until Susan started  asking for a ticket. Julie   Vance L Taylor Yes, vlt Julie Meyers Will this be for January forward? Vance L Taylor Julie, I have received the partially executed committed reserves contract from  Etoco.  The contract not only has meter #9614 attached to it but also meters  9651 & 9672.  We will generate a ticket to be entered into sitara ASAP.   vlt x3-6353 Julie Meyers What is the status of this meter.  This was the deal that was under Etoco.   Have we gotten a ticket setup yet? Julie Susan D Trevino Julie,  will there be a new deal/contract set up for this meter?  There are  valid actuals for 1/1 and 1/2 and I need to allocate these volumes to a  contract otherwise I will keep getting an allocation exception error.   Thanks, Susan.    Susan D Trevino Julie, Per our conversation yesterday,  the deals/contracts associated with this  meter have been terminated as of 12/31/99.  Please let me know what the  status is on this matter because the meter is still active and flowing and  there is no contract to allocate to.   Thanks, Susan x35796
