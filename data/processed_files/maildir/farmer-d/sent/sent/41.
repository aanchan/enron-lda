D Charlene Richmond Hesco is showing a price of $2.85 for tne 29 & 30 Daren J Farmer Charlene,  We should not have scheduled any volume for the 29-30th.  No price was  negotiated that I can find. However, since gas did flow, I rolled the last  price on the deal to cover those days.  What price is Hesco showing? D Charlene Richmond Daren would you look at the price for 29 and 30th of March 2000 .  There are  no prices for these days but volume was scheduled for these days. Thanks Charlene Daren J Farmer Charlene,  Deal #214948 already had volume and price for the 12th and 13th.  You may  need to have the volumes updated by Volume Management. I added the 15th and 16th to the deal ticket.  D Charlene Richmond Help .
