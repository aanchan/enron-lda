It's fine with me to allocate everything to Torch if they are paying for it. D 	Kimberly Vaughn 	 Daren..  Have you had a chance to look at this yet? Kim, Have you received a response on this yet? 	Kimberly Vaughn 	 Sheryln,  I'm forwarding this to Daren to get your answer...  Daren, deal  141186 (El Sordo) volume 102....  deal 138605 (Torch) volume 343...  Megan  Parker thinks that all of this volume should be under Torch...  What do you  think?     	 	 	 Kim, Have you looked at this yet?     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Have you heard anything on this yet?  I need to pay it by Thursday. Megan     	 	 	 I have a volume issue with meter 986315 for 1/00 production.  The volume has  been split between El Sordo and Torch Rally.  I think all of the volume  should be under Torch Rally.  Please let me know if you find something  different.  The old months have already been corrected. Thanks, Megan
