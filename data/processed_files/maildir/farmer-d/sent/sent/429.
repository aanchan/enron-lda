Tom,  Go ahead and increase the nom. D Daren do you want to bump that volume up per the information in this note  below.  George wanted to know and asked me.  It was previously nomed at 200.  Let me know what you think and I'll make the change if needed. Lauri A Allen George- In this afternoon's meeting with Producer Services, Jill mentioned that the  referenced well had been reperfed (meaning they shot more holes in the well  piping allowing more gas to flow out of the well) and was now producing  approximately 800/day.  Per Jill, the MDQ on this well is 3000/day.  You may  want to look at getting this nom revised for the rest of the month. Mary-  could you get Heidi or Lisa to check the transport rate we currently  show on this?  It's being purchased for SC-.17 and is flowing through King  Ranch.   Thanks.
