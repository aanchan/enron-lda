    	 	 	 In case you were not aware, you have the ability to control the Date display  format on your PC.  As we approach year 2000, you may wish to see all four  digits of the year to insure that when you enter '00', the system recognizes  it as 2000 vs. 1900.  Some of your column widths may need to be expanded to  Start/Settings/Control Panel/Regional Settings/Date tab, Short date style.   You may want to change it from "mm/dd/yy" to "mm/dd/yyyy" then hit OK. The screen print below may be helpful.  Please forward to others in your area  that may be interested.  Thanks, d.n.
