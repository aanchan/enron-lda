FYI.  You may want to check with someone to see if this will affect you this  weekend. D Romeo D'Souza The POPS Production database server will be down over the weekend for a 3  hour period for memory upgrade. Please let me know if there is a preferred 3hr window, if  there is no problem with y'all,  can we will request the maintenance  between 12-3pm  Saturday 10/21/00. I'll inform y'all of the actual timeframe once its finalized, since there are  other systems running on that server. thanks Romeo FYI The UNIX Infrastructure team  would like to request downtime on system 'aurora' this weekend.  The system has 2 faulty memory simms that we need to replace BEFORE they cause a problem.  We are requesting 3 hours to perform the memory replacement.  The following databases would be effected: eqtprod dcfprod popprod trdprod semprod sitprod2 infprd53 Please let me know if/when we can have time for this maintenance.
