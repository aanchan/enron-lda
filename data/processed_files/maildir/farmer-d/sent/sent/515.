Kim,  Deal 93485 has meter 7268 attached to it.  You can apply the flow to this  deal.  You may need to renom from MOPS to POPS to get it through the systems. D Lauri A Allen FYI. 	Kimberly Vaughn 	 Lauri ..  i have put this on strangas gas until I can get a contract from  daren. Lauri A Allen Kim/Anita- A volume of 7247mm shows to have been allocated to the Reliant 201 contract  for November.  There was no nomination for Reliant at this point in November  and, therefore, there should be no volume allocated to their contract.   Please make sure these volumes are moved off the Reliant contract prior to  November close. Thanks.
