Pat,  I think that we should probably send the newest people to the first  training.  What do you think? Liz, Susan, Mary, Sabrae? D Russ Severson Daren  The number of interested people turned out to be larger than the room can  handle.  Can you just send 3 or 4 for this meeting and I will set up a  secondary date for the others. Thanks Russ x37386  Daren J Farmer Russ,  I would like for the following people from the Texas region to attend: Liz Bellamy Sabrae Zajak Mary Poorman Susan Hadix Tom Acton Mark McCoy  Eddie Janzen Let me know if this group is too large and move some to a later date.  Thanks. D Russ Severson I will be giving a training session on Wed   9/13/00  in 21C2 from 3:00-4:30  pm. I would like for you to send to the class any new logistics personnel that  you might think could use a Sitara overview. If someone cannot make it at this time, let me know their names and I will  try to schedule something for them at a later time. If possible, please send me a note on who might be attending, so I can get an  approximate head count. Call me or e-mail me if you have any questions Russ x37386
