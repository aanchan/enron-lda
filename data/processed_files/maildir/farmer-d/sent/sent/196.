Bob and Mary,  Please talk to Vance Taylor about this. Daren Daren, This deal began in May, 2000.  I don't have a deal to book to from 12/99  -  04/00.  Could you please retro the deal, or please tell me whom I need to  speak to to clear this matter up?  Thank you for your time and patience The Rookie ext. 35251     	 	 	 Mary, BJD-ESS Corp is selling this gas to HPLC.  The deal ticket # is 258345.  This  is a gathering contract that is attached to the wellhead portfolio.  Let me  know if you need any other information. Bob Bob,   Could you help me find out who owns the gas at this meter...... Thank you Mary ext. 35251 Mary Poorman Pat,  This is the Texaco Fee CP, it flowed a total of 1,517 from Dec 99 to Apr 2  2000.  There is a Strangers Agmt. set up to take allocations, however, this  must be a wellhead related pt. that has declined.  How do I go about finding  out who this belongs to?  I thought about ringing Texaco, but, wanted to  check before I made any calls. Mary 	 Stephanie, you are correct.  There's no deal set up for this meter from 12/99  thru 4/2000. Mary, please take a look at the meter for the months in question and let  Stephanie or myself know whose gas this belongs to. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks     	 	 	 Anita,  If you are no longer handling this meter, please pass this email on to the  correct person. For meter # 6563, I have meter statements showing that volume did flow for  12/99 - 4/00 production on this meter.  I am not seeing this volume in volume  management for these production months.  For 5/00 and 6/00 production, the  volumes are there.  Is the reason because a deal number needs to be set up? Please let me know.   Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )
