I've extended the deal for the rest of the year, with a -0- nom. D Daren - Deal # 97929, meter 1450 expired Nov. '99.  Is there a way for you to  extend the deal or create a new one since there seems to be a little bit of  flow each month? - Aimee Fred Boas Aimee: There is a bridgeback error at the above referenced meter and month.  The  reason for the error is that the deal, # 97929 has expired.  Please determine  if the deal was to be extended or is there another deal to replace it? To fix this I will set up an accounting arrangement but what I need from you  is a valid deal number and the transportation contract that you want me to  put the deal on. Thanks in advance for your help, Fred
