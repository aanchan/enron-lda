What are the issues with this?  Is the problem a counterparty name issue?   Did we pay the wrong company?  Is Cleco billing us? D You put a deal in for Torch for this time frame at this meter to clear an  exception.  Should we put a new deal in with Cleco?  Let me know. Mary The person at Cleco / Foursquare  is Kara , her phone number is 281-556-8878 I have a note in Pops that Daren extended the Torch deal at this meter for  October.  If they are disputing the deal, please let me know and I will clear  this up with them. Mary
