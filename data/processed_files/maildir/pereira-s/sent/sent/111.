If the receivable is for ENA, it will have to be settled separately.  Andy  Ring talks to Koch for day trading.  Maybe she could pursue this. Susan Pereira I apologize for taking so long to respond.  I was out of the office Thursday  and Friday.  They are receivables for us. Is this a receivable for LRC or Enron? While doing my Accounts Receivable research, I came across two outstanding  invoice for Koch Enregy totally $2,934.60 from 1997.  Is it too late to  recoup the money via the settlement agreement?
