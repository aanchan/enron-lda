OH MY GOD, THIS IS WAY TOO FUCKING  WEIRD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I sent you the message below earlier today and had two emails waiting for me  this afternoon.  One indicating that I sent it to the wrong address and your  email.  I can't believe it!  The worst part about it is that, yes, I am  planning a trip to NYC, and I'm going to be there this weekend, which was the  point of my email this morning!  HOLY SHIT!  THAT SUCKS!  I can't believe  you're not going to be there.  When are you leaving/coming back?  I try to  call you, but I don't know if I still have you're numbers (I've been useless  since my Palm Pilot crashed).  Anyway, again, this is freaky.
