Mellencamp Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith St. Houston, TX  77002 Tel:  (713) 853-7986 Fax: (713) 646-3393 	Jeffrey M Keenan 		  Lisa: Ken Raber (electricities) and I discussed the option agreement yesterday and  came to the conclusion that any issues electricities has with the option  agreement will go to you directly.  I believe that will streamline the  process. The attorney's name is Mike Colo and his telephone number is 252-972-7105. I would really like to get this option agreement signed as soon as we can and  I'm sure you feel the same! If there is anything I can do let me know. Jeffrey
