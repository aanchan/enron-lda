Yes, this stuff is for the purchaser's bank. Kay:  Is there anything different from the forms you and I worked on earlier. Kent Hi Kent, I don't know whether Lee has mentioned the Delta Power deal that we are working on.  We are taking 4 turbines and putting them in an LLC, and selling some of the interest in the LLC to Delta Power.  Three of the turbines are turbines formerally known as LV Co Gen turbines, and we are buying new LM's to replace the ones we are using here.  In any event, Delta Power is financing the deal, and they have asked that we get GE sign off on the attached documents.  Therefore, I would be interested in your response to the attached. I understand that Lee is in New Orleans today, but I'll send him a copy anyway. Thanks, Kay This e-mail is confidential and may well also be legally privileged.
