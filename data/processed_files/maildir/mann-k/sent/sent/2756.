Hi Randy, Here's what you missed. My personal preference is to not spend the money to check out the licensing  issues at this point since I don't have the outside counsel doing anything  now.  When John called me last week and asked the question I gave him that  opinion, and I had assumed that it had been communicated to you.  Sorry about  that! Kay Kay Mann Hi there, I'm forwarding a draft EPC contract for your review.  This form of contract  assumes that the equipment will be procurred by the Owner, with the  understanding that we have not resolved the issue of the timing of the  procurement of the equipment, and  how it will be procurred. This is intended to be a discussion draft, and is subject to further Enron  review and comment.   Thanks, Kay
