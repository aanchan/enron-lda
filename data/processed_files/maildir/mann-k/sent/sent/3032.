fyi Chris, You have probably done this already but please insure that  accounting/transaction support (Herman Manis or Cris Sherman) have reviewed  the proposed sale structure to insure the appropriate accounting treatment  for this transaction. Also, I will need to review and approve all the agreements with NorthWestern  before they are finally agreed to between the parties and executed.  As for  the purchase of the assets out of the financing facility, Kay knows the  required documents from the Intergen deal.  There needs to be close  coordination amongst all the internal groups to insure your deal closes  timely and accurately.  Remember in your negotiations that the money from  NorthWestern needs to be received into escrow a minimum of 5 Business Days  before the closing date.  The financing requires the purchase notice (which  is irrevocable so if Enron provides it and NorthWestern walks, the turbines  are on Enron's balance sheet at 15% interest rate essentially) be provided to  the banks at least 5 but not more than 15 Business Days prior to closing date  for purchase from the financing vehicle. Thanks for the heads up. Chris,  Global Finance (Lisa Bills) needs to be kept in the loop on this,  since this is in TurboPark. Kay     	 Renee and Brian, Please prepare a change order to add dual fuel to the February '02 delivery  turbine.  The price and commercial information is below.  I have gotten Jeff  Darst to extend the deadline to exercise the change order to 16 March 2001. Please make sure we get the change order prepared before the deadline expires. Chris I did send it to the wrong address.  Sorry.    Chris,    The price to change this unit from Gas Only to Dual Fuel (distillate) is  $1,445,000.  Based on the payment schedule in Exhibit I-1, 32% of this  would be due the end of this month.  The remaining payments would be in  accordance with the payment schedule for Unit #2 in the exhibit.  We are  putting together a spreadsheet that defines this.    The offer to make this scope change expires at the end of this month.  After that time, we will be committed to the gas only configuration.    The CM&U group is putting together a proposal to convert unit #1 to dual  fuel.    Regards,    Jeff  Global Power Plant Systems  518-385-0663  518-381-1513 (fax)
