Kay I've already got a conference room and requested breakfast on 20.  Let me  know if she gets a room so I can change the catering order and call Rudy and  tell him we don't need his room. 		  Reagan Rorschach Kay, I'll take care of getting the room.   Tuesday--9.00 - 11.00 am I'll let you know what we get. Reagan     	Enron North America Corp.

I should mention 900am as the time!
