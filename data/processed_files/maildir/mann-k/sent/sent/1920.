The original GE West LB agreement, please.   I suggest that you contact Lee Johnson via email, copying his lawyer Kent  Shoemaker, asking for a proposed form of liquid fuel guarantee.   Kay I do not know what this guarantee looks like.  Liquid fuel is only referenced in Section 10.8.4.  Do you want me to send a blackline of what I sent out last night against the GE form agreement or the original GE West LB agreement? I think we'll have to add a section somewhere, perhaps 10.8.5, in the agreement. I'd like to try to keep all of the guarantees in the same Article of the Agreement. cc: If we aren't going to have any site specific information, then I don't think we need an Exhibit U. cc: Any ideas on this? Ben 03:48 cc: Ben, Exhibit U indicates that liquid fuel guarantees are in Sec. 10.8.4. I could not fine them in that section.  Could you point me to where the liquid fuel guarantees are located?
