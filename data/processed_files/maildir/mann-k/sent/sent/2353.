Sheila, Here's the latest I have, but there may be another turn in the works.  I've  asked Pete to send it to you, along with the GE.  I need to do an override  letter to pick up the agency stuff as well.  I spoke with Lisa about that  yesterday. Kay Peter--I'm attempting to get you a revised Exhibit A.  I'll confirm with Kay  whether we need Jody Pierce as designated recipient of invoices, or whether  we can have them sent to NEPCo so long as they go to Jody for payment.  There  is no comma before the LLC after E-Next Generation. Is there any other info  you need on the ABB breakout? We want to be able to execute it as soon as we  get you this info.  Thanks.  Al Larsen These changes have been made.  To complete this agreement, we need (a) a revised Exhibit A, (b)the response to the Don Hamond's question re. Section 6.7.2 and (c) confirmation of whether it is "E-Next Generation, L.L.C." or "E-Next Generation LLC". Alan       Larsen) Attached is an edited file for the ABB/Fountain Valley agreement.
