This is a slam dunk. Don't screw it up. Ok, seriously.  Carlos, you missed a wonderful evening on Friday.  John, it  is hard to believe that  you could have acutually have married UP.  Good for  you.  Please thank  Debbie for a perfect night.   For real? I'll process the assignment to John on Monday.  I don't expect a problem, and  am ready for it if it surfaces.  No big deal.
