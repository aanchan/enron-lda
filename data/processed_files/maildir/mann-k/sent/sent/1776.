Your thoughts? Kay Brett R Wiggs FYI.  A couple of comments on the GE contract. Brett John Guidry Brett, Just a few comments.  Exhibit H-2 Training and Exhibit B-2 Specifications  need to be added.  Exhibit N-1 does not have the unit price.  The Contract  Terms do not have the contract price. John Brett R Wiggs I failed to forward this to you guys yesterday.  Please work to come up with  consolidated comments as soon as possible.  Same comment on major problems as  opposed to small comments. Thanks, Brett Kay Mann The first of these two documents contains the key terms of the GE contract  for the ESA deal.  It was prepared by GE.  Your comments would be appreciated.
