Ok, I'm out of it.  Where's she going? There will be a surprise farewell get together, for Shonnie Daniel, in EB3872  (East Team Room), commencing at 3pm this afternoon.  Everyone is encouraged  to come and bid farewell to this very special lady.  Cake and coffee will be  served.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. Keegan Farrell (5-33117)
