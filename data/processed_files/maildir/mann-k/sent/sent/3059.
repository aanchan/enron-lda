Ann Elizabeth, Can you handle this?  This is another Florida lobby deal. Kay     	 	 	 I thought we decided to use gov. relations form? I don't really care;  whatever makes most sense and is most expeditious. Regards, Ben     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Attached is Tripp Scott's version of the revised engagement letter.  It's a  combination of their earlier version and ENA's standard form. Steve Steve, Attached is the Legal Services Agreement for your endorsement. Please fax to  762-2561. Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions. Ed   - #24129~1.DOC
