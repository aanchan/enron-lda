   I'll e-mail Neil about the SS number--no rush--I'm changing some end-of-year things and need it.  Please take some shopping time, and I look forward to keeping Michael for the parties.   cc:            When you have a chance, please send me Michael's Social Security number.            I'll be glad when you and Neil start going to some Christmas parties.            Thanks.           ++++++CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE+++++ The information in this email may be confidential and/or privileged.
