No.  I'll have Neil check (he does all that stuff). I was just wondering if you got that sorted out this morning.  I have copies  and will get them to you.  Have you checked to see if the checks cleared the  bank?   		  I have neglected to follow through on those dues checks that didn't make it  to where they should have.  Could I get a copy of copies you kept? Thanks, Kay
