Carlos and I are discussing options right now. Jake received a call from Rick Vicens.  Apparently, Delta has agreed to our  $68 mm in escrow at closing.  However, they have not agreed to the corp  guarantee.  Can we structure our LLC to free us from any liability instead of  having Delta's corp guarantee. Steve
