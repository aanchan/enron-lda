This is suitable for framing. 		  I'm a winner.  But alas the world will never know of my comedic brilliance. First, I would like to congratulate each of you -- you were the winners of  the Joe Sutton Top 10 List!  You have won a $25 gift certificate to the  Signature Shop.  (Please note that as of tomorrow, you will be able to order  eThink merchandise from the store!) There is, however, an unexpected down side to all of this.  As you are aware,  Joe Sutton has left Enron.  Due to his departure we are now unable to run the  list.  Your names will be published as winners of the contest, but we won't  be able to show the list. Please feel free to call me at (713) 853-9843 if you have any questions.  If  you don't get your certificate by the end of next week, please let me know. Thanks again for your fabulous entries. Warm regards, Sarah.
