Opps. Steve Montovano I still don't have a copy of the final LOI!  Please send to me at your  convenience.  Thanks! Kay Mann Great trip back.  I spent yesterday in Clarksdale Mississippi.  Don't make a  point of spending your vacation there! Can you email me Glenn's info so I can send him the hard copy? I enjoyed our time together, and look forward to more adventures.
