Sounds good.  Early in the week is better for me. Can we get together next week so I can get an update? Twanda will schedule. 		  There's a meeting with a cast of characters to discuss the Westinhouse  warranty issues.  It is tomorrow (Thurs) at 1230.  Do you have any interest  in sitting in? Kay The proposed agenda for tomorrow's meeting is as follow: Low frequency sound issue Use of evap cooler Heat Rate deficiency Late equipment deliveries  We can also talk about Wheatland performance. Let me know if there is anything else we need to add to the agenda. Thanks,   John
