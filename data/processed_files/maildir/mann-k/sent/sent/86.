I think you sent me an email which had some information from the gang about  the tests, etc.  Do you still have it? Thanks, Kay 	Sheila Tweed 		 Would you please call Mitcha and get the relevant information?  I suppose  that a demand letter (under the warranty?) could be in order but any  pre-litigation moves need to be coordinated with Richard Sanders.  Maybe this  hasn't risen to that level yet, but $12 Million sounds pretty serious.
