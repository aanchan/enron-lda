Pitiful! Charlotte confirmed for today? Delmis is cleaning as we write - I spoke to  Paige.  She is going to try to get an appt with Cher for cut/color.  I told  her we would buy. ckm So, your not buying it I see. Oh well, I tried. Guess I've got it as bad as you! Love, NM cc: I agree about skipping Sharon. It is his Spring break after all. I will tell her. Hey, don't worry, Michael can teach you about artificials! Just ask him! I don't know about you taking Rosco. I mean it doesn't matter to me you understand. But what will Kalie and Jack do without him? They will be so lonely! Who will chase Jack around when he's trying to pee or bite him on the ears? And who will be lazy with Kalie during the day? I'm just thinking about them don't you know...NM ps... Have you noticed how tall Rosco is getting? It hit me today as I was watching him with Jack. He's almost as tall as Jack! He's going to be really big!! cc: What are your thoughts? It is Spring break.  NM Neil, I will  be out of the office Wednesday and unable to receive e-mail regarding therapy on Monday 3/19.  Please call the office and leave a message if you will or will not be coming on Monday.  Thanks. Sharon
