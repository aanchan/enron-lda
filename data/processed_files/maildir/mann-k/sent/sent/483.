Kathy, Could you please accommodate Karen's request?  If you would like, you can  just send it to me and I will get it to her.  If you have delivered my  original to me I can make make her a copy. Thanks, Kay Karen E Carter Kay, I was wondering if it might be possible to obtain a copy of the Transformer  contract executed with ABB as well as any change order contracts which were  submitted to GE?  If you're not the person from whom I should request this  information, could you please point me in the right direction?  Thanks. Karen
