EECC may have this.  Can you check with whoever your team is working with, or  do you want a copy job of what was in the master agreement? Kay Exhibit B-1 was not in the electronic version of the West LB Agreement. Do you have an electronic version of this?  If not, can we get a copy from Lee? For the Enron South America and CA Development deals, we have used the attached Exhibit B-1 (with all changes accepted).  Should this also be used for the other deals as well or should we use the B-1 from the West LB Agreement? Agreemen       t Folks, John Ayres and I went through the Facility Agreement and Exhibits for the ESA Turbine Purchase Agreement.  There were a few edits needed on Guarantee Basis (F-1) and Scope of Supply Exhibits (B and N-2).  Also, one change to the Emissions Test Exhibit. John and I believe other than adding in the other Exhibits B-1 and H-2, this is ready for execution copy.  Kay, please add these in for the final circulation. Also, on the contract, a number of redlines were required to reflect scope of supply (addition of interconnect piping to cooling tower, unit liability amount, payment schedule adjustment and retention amount, guaranteed performance levels net of all GE supplied equipment aux. loads, guaranteed delivery schedule for purchased options. This should be ready to go, subject to a final review of the entire contract document. Regards, Lee Cc: Johnson, Lee L (PS, SSEP); Shoemaker, Kent (GEAE); Cheryl.
