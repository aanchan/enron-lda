FYI, Dale has the lead on this one. Thanks, Kay I have not circulated a copy of the LV Cogen/ABB Agreement since January 8, 2001.  I have not seen a 3/27/01 version.  I had previously sent an e-mail to Dale indicating that the contractor's  comments to the ABB Agreement were not made to the Exhibit B-1 of the LV Cogen/ABB Agreement that I have. What I currently have as Exhibit B-1 is what Dale had sent to me on January 5, 2001 as incorporating Don Hammond's comments. The current contractor comments contain many discrepancies (in addition to those that are shown as a redline).  Please let me know if I should only incorporate the contractor's redlined changes, or should I conform Exhibit B-1 to mirror what is in the contractor's comments? Perhaps if I could go through the contractor's comments with one of you, we could resolve what should and should not be in Exhibit B-1 of the agreement.  This also is an issue I need your help on.  Please review and respond to Peter, copy Tom Constantine. (or copy me and I will forward to Tom.)                                                         (Embedded     Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.    image moved                                                                                                                                                                                                                cc:      As I indicated in my January 8, 2001 e-mail containing the first draft of the LV Cogen/ABB Transformer Agreement, to complete the agreement we will need to amend Exhibit A to show the electrical losses guarantee as well as the base load for the units.  In prior deals we had one of the technical folks look at this.  In addition, please let me know which of the contractor's  changes, if any, I should make to the agreement. As I had mentioned in my earlier e-mail, it appears that the contractor's comments were made on an Exhibit B-1 other than the Exhibit B-1 attached to the LV Cogen Agreement as many of the numbers do not match up.
