The document on the bottom is the one you are looking for.  I will send one  of the exhibits separately. Kay     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	  Attached please find the execution copy of the LV Cogen/GE Agreement (the second document below), which incorporates the revised Retention Letter amounts.  I have also included a blackline (first document below) so that you can demonstrate to GE that no other changes have been made.  To complete the Agreement, the date of execution must be added to the first page and Exhibit H-2 must be inserted manually.  I believe that you already have a copy of Exhibit H-2 provided by Lee Johnson, but I will forward a copy momentarily.  <<Comparison of LV Cogen/GE Agreement Versions 4 to 5.DOC  <<LV Cogen Gas Turbine Purchase Agreement - Version 5.DOC   - LV Cogen Gas Turbine Purchase Agreement - Version 5.DOC
