Why not.  You can tell how much Michael seems to be enjoying school. I just got through to the Attendance line. It's says EC students need to have the absence reported directly to the teacher. I will leave a voice mail for Ms. Norris. Do you think I should follow it up with an e-mail too? NM cc: Thanks for teaching me. He never said a word about not feeling good. Love, Neil Hi.  Don't forget you can reach me by email. Good catch on the fever this am! Love, Kay
