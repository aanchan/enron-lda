Don't know the answers. We need to visit with Herman Manis to get his buy-in  on an approach.  I have a call in to him on another transaction, so I'll  ask.  Are you in Houston today? ckm Does the first option need to expire or can we terminate prior to expiration  and concurrent with execution of a new option agreement?  I got a call from  the owner of Certosa Holdings pleading for help on reimbursement of those  legal fees.   If we are going to pay a flat fee and renegotiate this  agreement, I think we need to do so quickly.   Regardless, I need to tell  them something soon.  They are getting desparate.  I've a call in to Taffy  Milligan. AEW's assistant to locate the Shutts & Bowen invoice.   I understand we have engaged Shutts & Bowen in Tallahassee to review some  property tax issue.  Cound this be an avenue to avoid this on balance sheet  hard cost thang? Yes we do want to renew the option through September of next year and we will  need to persuade them to lower the option premium.  Her is a thought:  the  land fill closure cost is approximately $2.9 million.  Could we create a new  option agreement that states that the strike price is $4.2 million ($1.3 the  original strike price plus the cost of land fill closure cost) so we could  pay an option premium of up to $210,000 (5% of $4.2 million).  At closing, we  reduce the purchase price by the costs yet to be incurred in the closing the  land fill.  Since Certosa Holdings will not start the closure until they are  assured that we will exercise the option if even then, the net cost to us  would drop back to  the original strike price.  Could we get this past the  accountants? Only the memorandum of option was recorded. I think the invoice was for between $20,000 and $30,000, but I can't  remember.  AEW has the invoice.  This probably will not be the final as we  will need to work with them in discussions with DERM on delaying the landfill  closure and in moving jurisdiction of the project from CZAB to the County  Commissioners.   I think Shutts & Bowen (who may get stiffed by their client  if this deal blows up) and Certosa Holdings would be open to any suggestions  and we need to renegotiate the option anyway.  Shall I call and suggest this  this flat fee for retooling the option agreement to them or shall we do it  together?  I,m not sure I could explain to them acequately the idiosyncrasies  of our accounting requirements. One more thing on the SDEC project:  According to the option agreement we  executed last October, we agreed to reimburse Certosa Holdings for actual  third party costs that they incurred in support of our necessary  applications, submittals and in seeking local approval.  Several weeks ago,  we recieved an invoice from Shutts & Bowen, attorney for Certosa Holdings  requesting reimbursement pursuant to the contract.  I forwarded this invoice  on th Ann Elizabeth not necessarily to pay for but to review considering this  whole soft cost hard cost discussion.  I recieved another call this morning  from Shutts & Bowen asking about the invoice.  What should I do?  Kay, Ann Elizabeth did not provide a designated hitter for the South Dade Energy  Center (Dade Development Company LLC is Optionee, Certosa Holdings is  Optionor) nor did she provide one for tne Medley Dunn project.  I have been  told that the Dunns are considering backing off their ultimatums that they  gave Ann Elizabeth and I regarding taxes to the town and assumption of  enviromental liability.  Who do I talk to about the Dunn contract while Ann  Elizabeth is out?   Kathleen Cc: Milligan, Taffy Kay Mann is the designated hitter for the Pompano and Deerfied projects while  I'm on vacation.  I've given her a down load of the status of Greg and  Steve's projects.  Chris Boehler at A&K will be the designated hitter for  Midway.  I'm not going to check my voice mail while I'm gone but, if  necessary, here are the contact numbers while I'm gone. If you call, Walter and Bernhard and Bernhard's daughter, Susanne, speak very  good English.  Monika's isn't bad.  Marlena may get flustered and hang up on  you. Best of luck at Deerfield and hope to see Pompano on track when I get back in  the office on June 11th.  Kay is planning on going to Florida on June 12 for  the moratorium hearing and the rezoning hearing.
