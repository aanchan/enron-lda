Ok, I give up.  What's an estoppel letter? Given the challenges that Carlos and I are currently encountering while  trying to obtain an estoppel letter from our Illinois landowner (Bob  Konicek), I believe that it makes sense on all our future land option  agreements to include language obligating the Seller to provide such letters  at our request.  This language could be easily included in the cooperation  section of the agreement and would likely go unnoticed or unchallenged by the  Seller.  It would simplify the site monetization process and avoid the Seller  being able to extract value from us in exchange for providing such a letter. Fred
