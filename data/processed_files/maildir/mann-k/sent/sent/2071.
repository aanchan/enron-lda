I'm trying to clean up after Blue Girl.  Can you tell me again who signs for  LJM so that I can get signature?  Who does their legal work?   Thanks, Kay Kay Mann With high hopes that this is the FINAL final version, I'm attaching what I  believe to be the execution copy.  Some things have been cleaned up, and  Brownsville has been added to paragraph 5.  I'm going to start collecting  signatures. Thanks, Kay
