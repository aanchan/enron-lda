My understanding is that Illinois is the only one, unless enovate will have  employees or inventory in any other states.  It is my understanding that it  will not.  Gregg, Russell, Matt, please speak up if I'm missing something. Kay Teresa Callahan to enovate.   Please advise when everyone is in agreement as to which states we need to be  qualified in so that I may prepare the necessary documents.  Thanks, Teresa 	Kay Mann 		 Enovate to enovate. Russell, I don't believe we intend to qualify in all of those states. Kay Russell E Murrell enovate.   Per our conversation this morning, please revise the name change documents to  reflect enovate with a lower case "e" rather than Enovate. We will be distributing marketing materials in Illinois, Indiana, Texas,  Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Alberta (Canada).   Thanks for your assistance.  Let me know if you need anything.
