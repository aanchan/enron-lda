I just noticed a glitch, which I'll fix.  Do you have any comments? Rusty is in Florida today through Friday.  I received the hard copy you sent  down (thanks) and will review it.   From your perspective, is this document  ready to be sent out?  I would like to get it in PSEG's hands ASAP.  Let me  know. Fred Have you asked Rusty?  I believe Kathleen gave him a hard copy yesterday.  I  made the changes myself. Kay: What is the status of the draft Securities Purchase Agreement for the sale of  ENA's Illinois project entities? Please let me know.  Rusty and I need to review it before sending it out to  PSEG. Thanks, Fred
