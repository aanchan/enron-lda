re: Coal fired plant we discussed with Mitch and John. John Moore Kay, I fiddled a little with the BPUB LOI.  You can see the redlined changes in  the attached document.  Kathleen FEDEX'ed two CA orginals to BPUB yesterday  evening and the plan is for them to sign the CA today, I will then email a  clean LOI to BPUB and to their outside counsel, Davidson, in  San Antonio.
