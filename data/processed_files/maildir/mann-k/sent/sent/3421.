Hi Pete, Per my voice mail. Kay 25-28   Nice try getting us to sign up for four more.  What a salesman!  I have made  some changes to reflect the First Amended and Restated  Agreement in  Principle.  Unless we hear back from you (call Steve) we will sign the  attached. I am also corrected the dates in the first paragraph of Appendixs C  to "April 4" . OK? 		  Sheila, I had that same version, so I accepted changes and updated to reflect our current agreement. Thanks, Lee  25-28  Importance: High   <<GETURBINEPURCHASEAGREEMENTLVCOGEN2_redline of execution  copy_40301.DOC  Steve,  Here's is the revised AIP to reflect what I agreed to with you and Jake.  I'll see what we can do to get the consent agreement done.  We know the  ball is in our court to firm the order for Units 25-28.  Thanks,  Lee  - GETURBINEPURCHASEAGREEMENTLVCOGEN2_redline of execution copy_40301.DOC
