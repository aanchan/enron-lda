Look at you.  More work! 	Sheila Tweed 		 Bob Carter has been working on this although he is transitioning it  to  Carlos Sole.  Bob already contracted for the DC tie line. 		 Are either of you familiar with  this project? We have had no contact with  the ENA/Enron Mexico commercial or legal people and I don't want to bust any  structuring goals. Our project manager (Scott Laidlaw) and engineer (Harry Okabayashi) want to  issue a tasking letter to procure engineering services on this project to  support the ENA work.  I am not in the office today, so please include Renee Alfaro on your response. JWVS 	Harry Okabayashi 		 Please clarify if our contractors including engineering services on the  Texas-Mexico HVDC project are required to be "off-balance" sheet. Best Regards, Harry Okabayashi
