It wouldn't be the same without you! Chris, Ben and Kay: Tomorrow's conference has been tentatively scheduled for 1430 hrs (CST), but, subject to Ben's availability, Kay would like to have an internal call at 1230 hrs (CST).  The dial in number and passcode are set forth below:   877-232-0064 25581#  Regards, Marisa cc: Chris, in case Kay is not in today, I provide this to you.  Please forward to Ben at your earliest convenience.  Thanks. Cc: Young, Michael; Kahn, Marguerite R. We have forwarded to you via facsimile our comments to the Letter Agreement and the LLC Agreement. The majority of our comments, as you will note, are intended to clarify the understanding of the parties with respect to the various matters set forth in such documents and are not intended to "change the deal". Except that, upon the advise of our tax counsel, we have adjusted the amounts of the promissory notes to be issued in connection with the transaction in order to maximize the LLC's basis in the Turbines. We believe this is consistent with your initial draft of the Letter Agreement. Also, please note that we have included additional language in Section 6 of the Letter Agreement which provides NorthWestern with the opportunity to consult with GE on matters relating to the Turbines. This reflects our understanding of an agreement that had been reached among the parties. With respect to the LLC Agreement, we would like to discuss with you the following: (i) the timing of the exercise of the Call Right and (ii) the intent of your proposed language in Section 7 relating to the rights of each Member to act in its own best interests with respect to the Call and Put Rights.  To that end, we propose scheduling a conference call on Tuesday afternoon, April 11, 2001.  Please contact me as soon as possible with a time that is convenient for your team. We look forward to hearing from you. Note: We will forward to you shortly, revised drafts of the documents for which we have drafting responsibility. ************************************************ Jeremiah A. DeBerry, Esq.
