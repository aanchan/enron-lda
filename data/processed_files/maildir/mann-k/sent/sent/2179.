I prefer the weekend.  It gives us a reason to get in and get out.   ckm No reason other than I don't really care to go. I really would like to do the FtW Show. Would weekends work best for you? I checked TicketMaster and all the weekend shows are available, even the "sold out" shows. I didn't check the price. They do have some weekday shows also if you would rather do that. NM cc: You do mind if we skip this party?
