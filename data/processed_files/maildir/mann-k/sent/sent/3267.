Thanks for the reply.  I found it on her desk! Kay Kay: What's the name of the organization that would have sent the form in? Vanessa 	Laura Schwartz 		  		  Hi there, I participated in an FFA auction with Matagorda County Fair, and gave my assistant the receipts to fill out the matching forms.  Unfortunately, she has since had surgery and isn't in the office.  The receipts are no longer on her desk, and the current temporary assistant doesn't know anything about it.  I was wondering whether a prior temp might have sent them in. Please let me know. Thanks, Kay Mann x57566
