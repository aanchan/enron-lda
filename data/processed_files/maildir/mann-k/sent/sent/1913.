I thought we weren't going to have an exhibit U anyway, since we are plugging  things into the text of the document. I think the real point of the question is the reference to the liquid fuel  guarantees, and where these will be reflected. Kay If we aren't going to have any site specific information, then I don't think we need an Exhibit U. cc: Any ideas on this? Ben 03:48 cc: Ben, Exhibit U indicates that liquid fuel guarantees are in Sec. 10.8.4. I could not fine them in that section.  Could you point me to where the liquid fuel guarantees are located?
