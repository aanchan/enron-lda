Please add this name to the Virginia Power part of the list. Ben, I spoke with the VA Power contact today who is responsible for the  interconnection agreement.  His name is Wayne Duman (804.257.4096,  He suggested e-mailing him dates when Enron was available to go to Richmond  to discuss the interconnect.  I don't know if you want to go or if you plan  on sending one of the developers, but will you schedule this meeting (since I  won't be negotiating this part of it). Thanks.  Let me know if you have any problems. Heather
