Missing you.... that Hancock funds would not be able to be scheduled for release for  Contracts, consents, etc.  in a timely manner.  This deal has been sitting out their to long and there is a concern that  Delta is buying time in order to survey the power markets in California.   Delta issued an RFP earlier in the week for power sales from their Pegasus  project and asking for responses by Thursday 4/26.  Immediate closure is critical.  Please provide me with the complete list of  Enron Deliverables that are outstanding and standing between Enron, Delta,  Hancock and Funding. Regards, Jake
