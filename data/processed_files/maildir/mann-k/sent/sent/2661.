Makes sense to me. I believe that Ben has talked with Janet on this issue.  My understanding is  that the units are still committed to the LV deal, but that ENA management  would consider a bona-fide offer from a 3rd party if the terms were right. Fred Does this mean the LV Co Gen deal has fallen apart, or are there some new  LM's in our future?
