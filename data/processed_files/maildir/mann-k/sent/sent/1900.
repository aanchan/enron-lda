fyi Kay, I took a whack at redlining for CO#1 Fountain Valley Agreement.  You'll need to do some touch-ups, I believe. Let me know what other changes will be necessary. Thanks, Lee All, Attachment contains latest revision reflecting order for two additional stacks, six power stabilizers and moving cost for the Fountain Valley Project.  Please review and let me know if additional changes are required or recommended.  <<changeorder#6rev2.doc Please note new contact information below: Mike Storm           g              GE Aero Energy Products                     A GE Power Systems Business           Michael E.
