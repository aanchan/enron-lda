How depressing would it be to be at EECC? And you know I appreciate it and am soooo glad to be over here. I am printing the Fee Agreement right now.  It is my understanding Marisa  Reuter is reviewing the Escrow Agreement, so I plan on calling her tomorrow  for her comments.  Then, the plan is to find out how many need to be executed  and get the ink. Also, I am revising the Incumbency Certificate right now to be signed by  Duran, Presto and Tricoli.  Kay, I will bring for your initials in a few  minutes. K- FYI Chris, per our conversation this afternoon, this e-mail will document the fact that, due to travel schedules, NorthWestern is unable to obtain the necessary officer signatures for the incumbency documents requested by Citibank as part of establishing the escrow arrangement called for under the Letter Agreement.  You agreed that NorthWestern could complete the necessary paperwork with Citibank on Tuesday of next week.  Thanks again for your flexibility. Michael J.
