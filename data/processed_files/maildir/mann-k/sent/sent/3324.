I got a form that consultants sign, and I'll compare them. Kay Here is the "Form B" that every employee signs.  I am not sure how helpful  this will be, but I wanted to make sure that whatever we ask the Enron  employees to sign is consistent, or at least not in conflict with, what they  have already signed.
