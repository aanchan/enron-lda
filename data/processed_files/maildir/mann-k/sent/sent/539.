You are a BIG HELP.   CDT)   Advice and clarity  - - -  Uh . . . sure,uh how about "There'll be a meeting  and everyone will leave happy?" CDT)   I have a heavy meeting/conference call schedule.  To be honest with you, I'm  a bit unclear on who is doing what with this.  Any advice/insight? Kay CDT)   Yeh, finally figured it out. I am trying to get out of town tomorrow, and  this is on top of some other hurry-up stuff, so I will likely miss. Scotty  will be there.
