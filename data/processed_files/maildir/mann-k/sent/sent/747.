Please see if you can get a conference room, allowing 2 hours for the meeting. Thanks, Kay     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 How does everybody look for a discussion concerning the VEPCO interconnection  agreement on Tuesday, Sept 19? I've checked with Christi, Mitch and Reagan, so they don't need to confirm. Details to follow... Thanks, Kay
