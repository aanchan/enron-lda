I really like that one.     	 	 	 Merchant Energy Ventures, L.L.C. (if it's available) Kathleen,  We need to set up an LLC for the Blue Dog turbines.  Chris had proposed some  names at some point, then Ben had come up with something.  I now can't  remember what it is.  Anyway, it needs to be on the list for next week. Thanks, Kay
