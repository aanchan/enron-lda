Pretty small stuff from a dollar standpoint.  Perhaps the sky is not falling. This seems too small to bother with. What do you think? Regards, Ben Ben, Per our conversation, attached is the requested Punchlist.  The original,  estimated value to correct all the discrepancies was approximately $250,000.   After our discussions with SSEP on September 19, 2000, staffing levels and an  increased productivity correcting the discrepancies took place.  Currently,  we estimate that SSEP has about $35,000 left to correct and we expect them to  finish by September 30, 2000.  Please note that the aforementioned  description does not include the discrepancy we discovered concerning  Enclosure Area Classification relating to gas migration.  We estimate that it  will cost approximately $2,000 per unit ($48,000) to correct.  Our  engineering is looking at this now and we plan to have an answer on this next  week. If there is any further assistance we can provide, please contact me at  713-646-8258. Matthew Tezyk Project Manager     	Enron Engineering & Construction Company
