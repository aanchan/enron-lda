First order of business.  Again, we can discuss this on Monday. I think Ben (or one of his minions) called Carolyn and asked her to be on a  telephone call today.  I have reacted with righteous indignation, and Carlos  is going to tell her it is not necessary for her to be on the call.  I really  hadn't intended for Carolyn to work on this transaction.   Talk to you Monday. Kay Here is the latest draft. Jeff 		  NorthWestern has agreed to our request to remove the Corp guarantee from the  letter.  We will change the dash to reflect the change. Ben and Chris, Attached is the revised Exclusivity Letter Agreement, black-lined to reflect the changes agreed upon this afternoon.  Your timely efforts to move this along for approval and execution within Enron is greatly appreciated.  I look forward to hearing your comments soon.  Regards.  <<Enron Excl. - Revised.doc  - Enron Excl. - Revised.doc
