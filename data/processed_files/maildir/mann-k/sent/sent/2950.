This is who Sheila suggested. The deal I'm working on is an asset management/control area services  transaction.  It will be an odd one, so I'm not expecting someone to have  specific expertise.  I need help on the general contracting under Miss law  stuff, especially since there are some quirks involved.  Your input would be  appreciated.
