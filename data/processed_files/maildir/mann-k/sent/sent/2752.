I've been researching the Pathfinder today.  Nissan has a pretty good  website.  I like the little videoscreen - how's that for a toy?  I'll go back  and look at the Toyota. ckm Yes, 34 cents. I will bring home some 1 cent stamps tonight. Grass to dig up...sounds like the beds are getting bigger already... I like the sound of the Highlander.  NM  cc: I think you are right about the 1700...that's a lot rock!! Michael saw Coach Chris getting out of his car this morning. Talk about excited! I didn't think he could get out of the truck fast enough... I walked the paper work to the school office. Hope your trip in was not too bad. There were three accidents between school and my office... NM cc: Wow, I just got this message... I think we should put the camera out of reach before there's no more film... I think we should call and have some stone delivered on the 19th. or even this Saturday. How much do you think we need? I'm glad your not sore and I think you are doing a great job with the yard. Eat out of the frig tonight? I'm thinking a sausage wrap and tater tots...Love, NM Good morning, Just checking in.  Michael and I had a good morning.  No weird outfits today.  Figures, since I now have a camera ready to go. So what do you think about the stone thing? I like the way Bob's front yard looks. I'm not sore today, but then again, I didn't do all that much.  Our yard is looking better, though. Hope you are having a good day. Love, ckm
