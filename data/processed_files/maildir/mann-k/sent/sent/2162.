Hi Brett, I haven't seen the fax yet.  I'll check around.  Maybe it got stuck in the  wrong pile. Kay Brett R Wiggs Kay: Did you receive the signature pages I sent by fax?  The quickest way to get  original signatures from me is to send the originals electronically.  I will  print out the signature pages and send them back to you by express mail (2  days from here). Thanks, Brett Kay Mann Hi there, and happy new year. I have a stack of turbine contracts which were waiting for signature.  I  believe the override letter needed signing as well.  Should I send the  unsigned originals somewhere? Thanks, Kay
