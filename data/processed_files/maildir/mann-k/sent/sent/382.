Michael problems. He has ADD and some other lesser learning problems.  We are  going to meet  with the specialist next week. I'm going to try to take off Friday afternoon as well.  We are thinking of  changing his school, and Neil and I need to go visit a new one. HECTIC! Are you ok? 		  Please protect Thursday afternoon, August 10th for me.  I have some important  personal stuff to take care of.
