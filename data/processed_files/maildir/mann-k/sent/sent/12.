I did not authorize anyone to initial any version of the document. Folks, We should not be making changes like this at this time.  This clause was part of the document (terms & conditions) initialed a month ago. Regards, Jeff Smith   cc: I tried to calling you on your phone, but it does not seem to bew working right. Jeff Blumenthal from tax has some final issues we need to discuss in section 5.2.4 of the contract and he will be sending an e-mail describing those issues later this morning.  That is the last remaining issue I am aware of before we can finalize and sign this contract, unless anything has poipped up the over the last couple days from GE. Can we meet this afternoon to arrange the signing of this contract with GE. Please call me back at 3-9548 and let me know. Thanks, Steve
