This looks like it belongs in the specs.  What do you think? Kay     	 	 	 Kay,  Please include Mike Nanny's verbiage below (on minimum design standards) in  the Purchase Order Contract.  Please call with any questions.  Thanks. Stephen Sorry in the earlier transmittal I was interrupted and sent the message by  mistake.  The red text below is what I added to insure that the minimum  design standards are satisfied.  From the discussion this morning, the  sensing instruments should or must be rated class I, div 2 and Fuelcell was  not willing to state that minimum was included in their design basis.  The  wording below should bring closure to this issue, when placed in the contract. Mike Nanny     	Enron Engineering & Construction Company 	 Mike: This is the recommended verbiage to address area classification issues: The electrical system design and installation shall be in compliance with the  requirement of NFPA 70 (NEC), in particular, Article 500 with respect to  Hazardous Locations.  The classification of locations shall be as recommended  by API RP 500 (Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for  Electrical Installations at Petroleum Facilities.)  The design compliance  with the NFPA requirements shall be demonstated in a design review or HAZOP  review meeting which includes representatives of Enron North America in the  review process. Regards, Dom
