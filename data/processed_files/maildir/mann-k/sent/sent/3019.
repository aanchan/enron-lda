Hi Jeff, I need more in-depth information than what I could get from King & Spalding,   so I asked around for a Mississippi firm.  Sheila suggested this firm, and  Stuart said he thought they were an ok group.  As you can guess, it is a  short list in Mississippi to chose from.  Please let me know what you think.

Thanks, Kay Walker Waters at the Brunini law firm.
