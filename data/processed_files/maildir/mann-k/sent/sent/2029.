Hey, they are making me crazy and I'm just reading your emails. Kay These guys are driving me nuts.  I assumed they could take the technical  specs from the existing master agreement and recreate it for the breakout  contract.  Apparently not.  Could you send me, or tell me who I could get to  send me, the exhibits to the previous master agreement, so I can show them  what we  need, for basis conditions, scope of work, purchase price, etc.   Thanks,  I am not sure what you are asking for both maybe the scope of work.  I  believe the scope should simply be six combustion turbines complete with  spring option and four exhaust  STACKS.  The water injection skids were  options also.  I am on vacation but please call me at 936-399-4831 as son as  you receive this.
