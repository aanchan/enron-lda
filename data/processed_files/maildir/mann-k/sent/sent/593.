Chris/Ben, We had discussed having two change orders so that the ESA stuff is easily  identifiable/assignable/etc.  Is this still the plan? Kay     	 	 	 In addition, the dual fuel cost will be split between ESA and ENA ($280,000  to ENA and $280,000 to ESA). Chris     	 	 	 Kathy and Kay, I have revised change order #2 to account for the additional scope added by  ESA.  Please review  and comment.  I did not change the effective date. For information purposes, all but item "b" are attributed to ESA. Regards, Chris
