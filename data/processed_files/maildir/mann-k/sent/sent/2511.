   This sounds good.  I would love for him to participate.  Since it would be at Enron, I can't see any problem.  If you were out of town, I could take him home or work it out with Neil.  Anyway, if Paige is accepted, I would be happy to be backup.  Since the pickup is at Enron, in case of an office emergency (which I seriously doubt), I could pick Michael up and bring him to my office for the short time required to finish the job.  As I said, I think this is moot, but we would have it covered from all angles. cc: (Embedded image moved to file: pic25605.pcx)           ++++++CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE+++++ The information in this email may be confidential and/or privileged.
