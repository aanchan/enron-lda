I like that idea.  Do we know what the guarantee is supposed to look like?  I  don't have the agreement with me (see below). At last word the Coral deal was sidelined.  More to come. I'm at home with a sick child today.  When you have a redlined version of the  ESA stuff (redlined against the master), please email it to my assistant,  Suzanne Adams, so she can print it and have it delivered to my house.  If it  is being printed by AK in Houston, please have it delivered to my house at 29  Inverness Parkway, Houston, 77055. Thanks, Kay I think we'll have to add a section somewhere, perhaps 10.8.5, in the agreement. I'd like to try to keep all of the guarantees in the same Article of the Agreement. cc: If we aren't going to have any site specific information, then I don't think we need an Exhibit U. cc: Any ideas on this? Ben 03:48 cc: Ben, Exhibit U indicates that liquid fuel guarantees are in Sec. 10.8.4. I could not fine them in that section.  Could you point me to where the liquid fuel guarantees are located?
