Lined against 3 sounds good.  Circulate to me, Bill, Dale, Lee, Kent  Shoemaker. Kay Once these changes are made (on Version 5) and the changes received from the contractor (currently in Version 4) are removed, do you want me to circulate a blackline against Version 3, which I believe was the last version seen by Lee Johnson? If so, who do you want to receive copies of Version 5 of the LV Cogen Agreement?    Peter, from what I can see, the GE E NExt B/O rev 4 doc appears to be ok. (Scope, $$$, and LDs) Please get it signed and the final distributed to us before April 30th.
