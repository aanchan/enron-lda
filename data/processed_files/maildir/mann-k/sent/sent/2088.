It was a format agreed to for all the LM's because the intent in  most cases is to sell the project (and the equipment), and the terms in the  override letter only apply when the equipment is in the financing structure.   Kay Kay, was this letter necessary b/c accounting rules did not allow us to have  these items in the Purchase Agreement?
