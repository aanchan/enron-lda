I'm not sure I understand it.  I wonder if they mean payment in full has been  made as of the time of the assignment. I'm clearing some other stuff off my desk so I can get to this, hopefully  this afternoon. Kay Kay: The last sentence of this clause was not included in my last draft.   After  being on vacation for four days, I can't remember why I did or didn't do  what.   Please let me know if you agree that this last sentence should be  added and if there are any other changes needed. Thanks. Kathy Dear Team, Dave mentioned that probably the only other change would be in the assignment section article xxii and that should not be any big change.

Internal Mike,      When  we  spoke  this morning, Dave advised that one change to the  language that  will  be  required is  the addition of the words in red , in bold added  by ABB at the end of this paragraph in section 22.2 of the contract.      In  the  case of an assignment to a party described in (ii), (vi), or  (vii) (other  than   Enron  Engineering  &  Construction  or  NEPCO),  Seller shall  be entitled  to  request  and  receive  an  appropriate guaranty, letter of  credit, payment  bond  or  other  reasonable  form of payment security, in amount not  to exceed the amount of the Purchase Amount remaining to be paid at the time of  the assignment,  unless  the  assignor  agrees  to  remain  liable  for  all   future liabilities  under  this  Agreement.  A letter of guaranty, letter of credit,  or payment bond provided by an entity rated BBB+ or better shall be deemed to be  an appropriate  form  of  security  for  the purpose of this provision , so long  as payment  in  full  has  been  made  in accordance with the schedule set forth  in Article VI.      Additional commentary may come later today when Dave reaches his first  stop on his flight back to Raliegh.      Frank  - pic05234.pcx
