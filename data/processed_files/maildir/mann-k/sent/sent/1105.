Hi Kathy, I can't remember if you are in the loop on this one. Kay I believe that this is the most recent version.  Lee, check the dates to make sure they are right. Kent  <<SSlttrsept29rev1.doc  <<SSlttrsept29rev2.doc Kay, Attached is a redline version of Sept 29 letter, and clean copy for sign/send.  The change involves reference to the contract paragraphs that deal with corrections, enabling Enron and GE to reach agreement on timing of performance of corrective work, if we both agreed to a schedule other than prior to delivery to site.  We recognize that if any of this work has an impact on your EPC contractor's site work schedule, there maybe other consequences/remedies, as provided in the contract. I'll sign and fax.  Hope you all have no objections. Thanks, Lee (See attached file: SSlttrsept29rev1.doc) (See attached file: SSlttrsept29rev2.doc)  - Change Order #4.doc
