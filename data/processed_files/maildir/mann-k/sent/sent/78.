Here's the attachment. Sorry guys: I added the clause on the Parent Guarantee and without thinking, made it a GE  obligation.  It was supposed to be an Enron requirement.  So I have corrected  that in Clause 15.  GE already has the same obligation in the Contracts.   John Schroeder:  This will be the Version that we execute, so please forward  this one to your guy in Mexico.
