Billy,  It is expected that by the time the hard costs referenced in #2 are incurred,  the project will be in E Next (or its successor/take out vehicle) since  construction will be nearly complete.  Costs incurred in #3 should be Phase 2  E Next costs, since this should be in the construction period, although it  could be immediately prior to that time.   Lisa, I skipped Rose on this email since she is out of town, and reviewed  this agreement before she left. Kay See comments therein. Hello. The commercial team  has asked that I forward this document to you for  review.  It is a development agreement for a project in Florida.  We have  attempted to address the accounting/E-Next issues, but please advise of any  desired changes. Thank you, Kay  << File: Deerfield development ag May 31.DOC   PS  Pardon the formatting.  It will be cleaned up by those with the ability  to do so.
