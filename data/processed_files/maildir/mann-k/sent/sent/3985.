Herman, this is the document I called you about.  AE is out-of-pocket, and  has some questions about this agreement, so she asked me to forward the doc.   This is a doc for a 40 yr ground lease for a power plant.  It is my  understanding that the counterparty is not interested in an option  arrangement. Kay     	 	 	 Ann Elizabeth Attached is the turn of the draft that Balog did on the Dunn / Our Security  Corp V contract. Greg     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Stuart Attached is a revised draft of the lease agreement both as a clean copy and  red line comparison to the draft that you sent.  I would be glad to explain  the reasons behind the changes included.  The changes in the insurance  section are taken from the input of our insurance department. To answer your other question Andrew Balog at Greenberg is not a relative but  we are both Hungarian.  I don't run across many with that name especially  outside of the northeast and midwest. Roger
