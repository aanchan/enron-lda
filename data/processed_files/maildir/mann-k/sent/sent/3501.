Chris, I haven't heard when they expect to have their financing.  We are finishing  up the break out contract with GE, and assuming we tender it tomorrow, they  will have until April 19th to fund the escrow.   Kay Steve and Kay, How are things going with Delta?  I want to push them hard to close. Regards, Chris
