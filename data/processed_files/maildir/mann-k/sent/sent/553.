Hi John, Looks like it is worthwhile to finish up what you were working on before.   Thanks, Kay Ray Hoppe Kay, I left a message for you earlier.  I need to know where we left this  document?      Tammy,      I decided to go ahead and draft the Consignment Agreement in the      interest of saving time. I'll send you a copy later today, but I      thought you might want to let Bob know so we don't duplicate efforts.      The Agreement will generally follow the form of the Mitsubishi      agreement.      Steve
