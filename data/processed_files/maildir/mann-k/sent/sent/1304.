We want to have an internal conference call at 330 (instato discuss the  enovate intercompany loans, and address any issues raised by the Enron  commercial/financial team.  I don't know the substance of the comments. Kay Early morning is full, but I'm free at 10:00 and several hours thereafter.   Would this be in addition to or in lieu of the 3:30 call?  Also, do you have  any heads-up re:  what the comments will be? Thanks.  Heather What does your schedule look like Wednesday am? Thanks, Kay cc: What about Wednesday morning to discuss Bracewell's draft of the intercompany loan agreement?  Kay could you check Heather's availability? Anyone else that should be included? Thanks, Gregg
