Okay.  My exit strategy didn't work and I got these back.  Lee said to ask you to send to me the Salmon Facility Agreement.  Is this the same as Delta. Also, what other documents will we have here.  Will there be any override letters, assignments, consents (other than below)?   Do I have any hope of getting out of the opinion.  What good is an in-house attorney's opinion anyway.  It may be a stumbling block as we've never given one before and I don't know how long approval procedures may take. Are the documents below up to date. Too fun!!
