Well, here's the nearly final draft of what was submitted.  Evidently, we  decided to submit a bid on the original transaction structure, as well as two  alternatives. (not what I was lead to believe before.)  I spoke with John  about adding more disclaimer language to the letter to say that by submitting  the bid we aren't agreeing to enter into a transaction or even negotiate for  a transaction.  Also, I advised him that the confidentiality statements in  the letter were not great protection.   Kay John Llodra Please see attached final draft of the NiMO proposal letter.  I will be  please provide any comments ASAP.  thanks John
