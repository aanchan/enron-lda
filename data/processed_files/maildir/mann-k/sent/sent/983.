The water could be 100 feet or more away from the dock, depending on how long  it blows that hard.   I hope our shrimp come back. Both! I agree that having Matt come to our house the first time is best. I had already looked at the weather. North winds to 25 mph. How much water would be left in the bay? Connecticut's new. You haven't been there with Enron have you? Better take a coat!! Saturday the 14th is my Saturday to work. I can bring Michael with me if necessary. No big deal. cc: You were right, it does warm my heart. Thanks for sharing. It certainly appears God is trying to show us we made the right decision, don't you think. cc: Dear Kay, Glad to hear Michael has settled in already.  We seem to have a great class and Mrs. Norris is a wonderful teacher!  Please call at any time if you have any questions  that I can help answer or point you in the direction of trying to get them answered. We would love to have Michael over one day after school.  Matt has told me they have been playing together and he wanted to know if he could come over. I told him I would talk with you and see if we could set something up. Please call if you think Michael would like to come play and we can work something out. (If Michael needs to settle in a while, I certainly understand.) Our # is 713.984.0126.  Hope to hear from you soon!
