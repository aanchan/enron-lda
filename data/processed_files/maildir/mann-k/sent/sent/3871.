Gentlemen, These docs are ready to go, and your signatures would be appreciated.  I will  initial the docs when Steve delivers them to me tomorrow. Kay Kay Mann We need the Assignment and Assumption and Bill of Sale signed. Kay Kay Mann Hi Catherine, I don't remember who actually gives the notice, but in anticipation of the  funding of the escrow tomorrow, here are the docs. I understand there is also a two day notice.  I don't believe I've seen a  form for that one yet. Who should send this out tomorrow after we get the fed ref? Thanks, Kay
