How about notices going to CA Development, "care of" this contact.  CA  doesn't have any employees. Shouldn't these  be cc's under the Facility Agreement?  Don't we want CA Development to also get copies of all notices? Notice under the Facility Agreements should be as follows: Sweetgum Energy LP c/o InterGen North America LP 909 Fannin, Suite 2200 Houston, Texas 77010 Attention:  John Jones Telephone:  713-374-3900 Facsimile:  713-374-3901 For the purposes of completing the facility agreement, we need the name/address of the contact person for invoices, etc. Thanks, kay
