Ben, What are these folks supposed to do for Enron?  I had heard a rumor that we  were looking to hire someone to lobby for us on a success fee basis.  Is this  the same deal?  I know on the international side there were hoops to jump  through before such an engagement could be signed off on.  I'll have to check  to see what the drill is on this side of the street. Kay     	 	 	 Per my earlier e-mail, attached is Tripp Scott's form. As discussed, Roger has no problem engaging Tripp Scott.  He does want to use  Enron's standard 9 page engagement letter in lieu of the attached 2 pager  received from Tripp Scott.  Is this necessary - any thoughts? Steve   Steven Krimsky As discussed in Fort Pierce, Tripp Scott is that insurance policy I've been  looking for to help secure the commission vote in Pompano.  Tripp Scott will  also assist us in our door knock campaign in the County & Tallahassee.   Pozzuoli is a mover & shaker and is on a first name basis with Jeb Bush -  he  was the Chairman for the Bush/Cheny Broward County re-count. Bill Keith & Debbie Orshefsky highly recommends the engagement. Lets discuss Tuesday. Steve It was a pleasure meeting with you and Debbie on Monday afternoon.  Per our  discussion, enclosed is Tripp Scott's proposed terms of engagement as well as  an abbreviated description of the firm and its key directors. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
