In connection with the attached, please note the highlighted language at the  end of the document.  We couldn't decide what it means, so it needs to be  re-written or deleted. The party we are contracting with is Virginia Power, not NC Power. If we  misstated this previously, we would like to clear it up now. Thank you, Kay Mann Reagan Rorschach Please review and forward to Mary Lynn Griggs at Kilpatric and Stockton.   Thanks, Reagan
