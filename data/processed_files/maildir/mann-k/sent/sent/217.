FYI. Curtis: As a follow-up to our discussions yesterday afternoon, I need to obtain a  copy of the PERC/West LB Agreements on the financing vehicle for the PERC/ABB  Turbine Purchase Agreement(s).  Kay Mann requires these documents ASAP in  order to finish preparing the proposed Enron/PERC Agreement on the ABB  turbines.  Please fax these documents to Kay Mann directly at (713) 646-3491  (Kay's phone # is 713-345-7566).  You can reach me on my cell phone at  (713)412-4612. Fred
