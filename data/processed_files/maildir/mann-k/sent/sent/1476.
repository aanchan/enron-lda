Hi Don, I'm not connecting this with anything on my "to do" list.  Were you looking  for someone else? Kay RE: " the possible purchase of a 504 MW (nominal) electrical generation plant  in Lowndes County, Mississippi (the "Caledonia Plant") and a 494 MW (nominal)  electrical generation plant located in Haywood County, Tennessee (the  "Brownsville Plant")". Thanks, Don 3-0492
