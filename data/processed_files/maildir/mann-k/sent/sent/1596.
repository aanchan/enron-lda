Please note.  I called Cher. Brett is meeting with me in my office at 1:30 p.m. Houston time to discuss  the closing.   Please let me know if you can be there; Melba is trying to  find a conf. room if the response is good.   If you cannot attend, but can be  available by phone, please let me know that also; I can get a conf. call set  up.     Luiz - are you in SP or Rio today? Thanks, Rose
