I forgot about Grandma.  I bet you love the temperature today (BRRRR). Hamburgers sound good to me.   was worse to get up. I had to drag him out of bed this morning. He is not a morning person like his mom. I think he is more like his sister in that regard. We made it on time and he even finished breakfast. Remember I will be taking grandma to the doctor today. If the weather holds maybe I will grill burgers tonight and get Michael can get to bed early. Love, Neil cc: the plan for what? so what's the plan?
