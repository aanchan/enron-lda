I went to Sheila's meeting.  Barbara and Jeff were there also. Hmm.  Don't know about the faxed signature.  Feel free to call Carolyn  Campbell at King & Spalding and ask. 713 276 7307. Find out about faxed  signature, and whether tomorrow is too late.  We need the escrow account in  place by FRIDAY. Is Mike Miller in? Ozzie would be fine, I guess. Thanks, Kay     	 	 	     	 	 	 Kay, Bad news.  Ben also will not be in until tomorrow. 1. See if I can get a faxed signature for Ben (if Citibank will allow faxed  signatures) 2. Get Delainey, Pagan and Dietrich's signatures today and wait for Ben's  original signature tomorrow I guess I missed Sheila's 10:00 meeting.  It's kind of confusing as to how  long we are supposed to attend her meetings since we are with the East Group  and she is with the West Group.  Did you go?  I am going to Barbara Gray's  meeting at 1:00.
