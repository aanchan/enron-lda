I had a HUGE lunch (Vincent's), so something  light sounds good.  We could do  the usual appetizers at Grotto. Yes. Paige will watch the menagerie. Where would you like to meet? NM  cc: So can I buy you dinner and a drink? NM cc: Our computers and phones have been going up and down all day long. Are you guys still going out tonight? Please let me know if your plans change and maybe your husband could take you out. NM cc: Have you received any e-mail from me?  NM The closing dinner for the big financing will be on Feb. 8. Just thought I'd keep you current! Love, Kay
