Sounds good so far.     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Kay - That should work, since our 3:00 is being obviated by our 12:30. Mitch It doesn't look like Friday morning will work.  How do you guys look for  Thursday afternoon at 3:00 p.m.  We can have the meeting in EB38C1.  Please  advise via telephone (x37340) or email asap!  Thanks! 		  In an effort to pull the pieces together, a meeting has been scheduled to  discuss the draft energy and capacity contract (formerly the PPA).  It is  scheduled for Thursday, August 24th, at 900am.  We are still in the process  of locating a conference room, so the location is TBD. Thanks, Kay Here are the most recent comments from VEPCO: Some of you may have received this already.  I have not compared it against  what we last sent them.
