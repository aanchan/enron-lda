Here we go with a renewal that puts us to 7.6%, but the purchase price is not  so much.     	 	 	 Kay, The payment that is due on Saturday will put us at 7.631%.    I really would  like to Federal Express out tonight because the November payment got lost in  the mail and I had to order another check to send to them.  Please advise.
