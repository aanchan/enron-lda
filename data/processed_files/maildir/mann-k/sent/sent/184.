I am not responsible for THIS Tribasa mess.  My responsibility ended when  Tribasa IV was signed. Buenas suerte, Kay In retrospect, I apologize for not contacting Ms. Mann earlier (my former  colleague who is responsible for this Tribasa mess) for she indeed did  confront the issue that we are confronting.  Based on the attachment below  and the other emails I am forwarding you, it appears that our procedure for  accelerating EECC's payment rights will be to issue a letter to Republic Bank  who will then issue a default letter to Tribasa and then based on that we can  then issue a demand to AI.  If Ms. Mann so desires, she is welcome to  participate in our 2:45 conference call, by rsvping through email. here's one. Kay, Attached please find the letter to Republic National Bank.  I just got the  original you sent me yesterday. Best regards, Thomas  - 7HV01!1.DOC
