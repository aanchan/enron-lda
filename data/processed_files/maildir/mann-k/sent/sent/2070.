Hi Carlos, Could you please get Dick to sign this?  Can he sign for NEPCO also? Two original sigs is enough. Thanks, Kay Kay Mann With high hopes that this is the FINAL final version, I'm attaching what I  believe to be the execution copy.  Some things have been cleaned up, and  Brownsville has been added to paragraph 5.  I'm going to start collecting  signatures. Thanks, Kay
