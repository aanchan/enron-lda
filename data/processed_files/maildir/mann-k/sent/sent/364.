Ed, To clarify, the Edgecombe we were discussing is in North Carolina.  The New  York deal is a separate deal. Thanks, Kay Lisa: One of Kay's developers wants to acquire a land purchase option in Edgecomb  County, North Carolina ("Edgecomb").  While I recall setting up Edgecomb for  you, I don't recall whether Edgecomb actually acquired land purchase  options.    Is this acquisition a coincidence?  Are we resuscitating an  asphyxiated deal? Thanks, Ed 		  Thoughts? 	Kay Mann 		  I have some folks who want to option some land in New York.  Do we have a  company for New York yet?  If not, I seem to recall that we were going to  start using one of the existing companies for land options instead of  creating a new one every time.  Am I remembering that correctly?   Basically I'm looking for the company name to use in an option.  Any  suggestions? Thanks, Kay
