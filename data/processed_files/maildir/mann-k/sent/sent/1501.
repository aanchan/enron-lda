    	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Meant to copy you. Mitch     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 I talked with Westinghouse this morning.  They have some minor changes to the  agreement.  They'll have the changes back this afternoon.  If the changes  reflect what they described on the phone, then we'll be ready to sign  tomorrow morning. Mike, are you in tomorrow to sign? Mitch
