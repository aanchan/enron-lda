Does Bill know this?  Lee is going to want to know that you guys are on the  same page. Kay Yes, the stabilizer definitely belongs in the contract.  It has been included  in our price to Delta. Steve, I know that we specifically included the stabilizer in the Salmon deal.   Please confirm that it belongs there so that we can finish up the break out  contract. Thanks, Kay Kent/Kay- I've redline the Salmon contract for Exhibits A and B, Purchase Amount, Maximum Liability Amount, and Unit Liability Amount.  The Power System Stabilizer has been struck from scope, because I can recall Bill Williams advising that LV would need them, Delta/Salmon would not.  That's consitent with the other units going to CA (w/ Intergen).
