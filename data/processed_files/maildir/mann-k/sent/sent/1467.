Your suggestion is probably cheaper for Enron! Tell them to reverse the CompareWrite and redo (should be an easy fix). Otherwise, we can just agree to all of GE's suggested changes and call it a day! I just opened the redline that I just forwarded to you all.  I apologize, but it is still wrong.  The language I added shows up as a strike-through and ther language I deleted shows up as though added.  I am desperately atempting to get this straightened out.
