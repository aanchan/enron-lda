That would be great.  We can leave his "stuff" by the front door.  I know he  will have things he wants to bring to show you. Michael asked me for advice yesterday.  ("Mom, I have a problem...").  He now  has 2 girlfriends, Ashley plus a new one, Marilyn.  He was torn.  He decided  to stick with Ashley. Oh, the problems of a 6 year old!! Michael is very excited about the weekend.  He just doesn't think it will be  long enough!! Thanks for everything, Kay    No problem as far as I am concerned.  I can just pick up the antibiotics and anything Michael has forgotten on the way back after I pick him up. cc:            Don't forget to let me know where you will be staying in San Antonio.  Also, what is Michael's doctor's last name.  I know it's Reynaldo something.            Thanks.  Have a great time and don't worry about Michael.
