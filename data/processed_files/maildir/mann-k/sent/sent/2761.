This looks good to me.  We'll track down Janet if that is ok with you. Kay     	 	 	 Kay, The enovate appointment looks fine, but I made minor changes to the signature  block if that is okay. The enovate appointment looks fine if Janet can still sign as Managing  Director of ENA. Kay Mann Hi. This is one of my top priorities.  I think it looks fine.  What do you think? Kay Kay Mann Let's discuss. Kay - have you had any chance to give this some thought?  We are about to  take some actions that require Board approval so I would like to get this  finalized. Let me know.  Also, I am trying to get back on the Intercompany  loan stuff.  I am going to be in Houston next week and have Wednesday pretty  open.  Are you going to be in town?  If so, maybe we could get together for  half hour or so to go over the loan stuff. Thanks - Gregg 	Gregg Penman 		  It looks like your memory serves you well.  Section 6.8.2 allows the Managing  Member to designate officers of enovate.  I revised the original appointment  declaration you prepared to reflect Laura as VP.  Take a look at it and let  me know if it works.  If so, I will probably ask you to have Janet execute it  at your convenience.   Thanks - Gregg
