Boyd, I am not sure you have seen this agreement.  If you haven't, please give it a  look for "fatal flaws", or information you think we need to be informed. Thank you, Kay     	 	 	 Kay - Sounds like Jeff is okay with the affiliate Master Purchase Sale  Agreement from an Enron transactional point of view.  As this document will  be filed with the ICC, I want to make sure that Boyd is agreement.  Assuming  Boyd gives the all clear, we need to decide if we intend to file this right  away or wait for the Hub Agency Agreement to be completed and make a joint  filing.  However, I am cautiously optimistic that we are not too far apart on  the Hub Agreement.  We had a commercial meeting yesterday and despite the  obstacles presented by my supposed MEH partner, Roy, I think we made some  headway. Talk to you later, Gregg Attached is a memo regarding the above.
