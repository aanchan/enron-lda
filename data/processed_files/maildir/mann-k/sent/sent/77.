This is the most current information I have on specifications.  I sent Ben and Mike an email about the 12th slot, but haven't heard from  either one of them. By the way, I was asking about whether the changes I had suggested for the  transformer contract had been included in the Calumet equipment purchase   terms, as I was confident the changes are in this agreement. Kay     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 FYI. Kay,      See attached rev 4 of the document you sent me with the revisions that we discussed.  I have signed the letter and initialled the 6 pages and will fax them to you at 713-646-3491.  If after your review there are any additional questions at Enron feel free to call me.
