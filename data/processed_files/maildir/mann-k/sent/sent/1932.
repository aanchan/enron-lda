thanks-Carlos talked to me yesterday and is excited at the prospect of the Mexican work.   Rose hasn't called me yet-thanks for the intro. More tickets are available-as many as you want (I think you're the only real fan in the group).  Hadn't heard the Biggio story-I'll check into it and pass any gossip.  I think Asmus will be a good addition, but we still need a good starter.   cc: Que paso con Coral? Heard from your assistant that your son is sick-hope all is well.
