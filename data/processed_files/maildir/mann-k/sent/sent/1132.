Hi Chris, Any opinion on the major component question? Kay Taking a quick look at the CO I am not sure what are GE's comments.  Do we  have a redline copy showing GE's comments? I can't remember if I made this comment previously, but are the exhaust  stacks considered "major components" (or whatever the correct defined term is  under the Agreement)  for purposes of delay LD's?  If so, then we need to  revise the CO accordingly.   Also, do we need the defined term "Purchase Amount Increase" in Section 3(b)  in Part II?
