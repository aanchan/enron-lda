Just go ahead and turn it, putting in a [Note:] for any missing pieces.  That  will make it easy for me to search.  Thanks, and have a good weekend. Kay Will do.  Do you have the serial number and delivery date for the new turbine?  Do you have the specifics on how the payment schedule will change? Do you want me to wait for that info before I turn the new draft?  I need to leave the office today no later than 3:45 CST.   cc:       IIproject No problem.  I left you a voice mail message.  This looks like the agreement that I made these revisions to and sent to Carlos Sole (and copied you on) on March 20.  That agreement deleted the agency references, etc. and included Lee Johnson's changes to some of the specific performasnce guarantees in Article 10.  It did not, however, include turbine 28. Let me know if you want me to revise the atached document or the one I sent to Carlos.       project Bill Williams has confirmed that the attached version of the LVC-2 contract is the final form.  I have added a footer stamp identifying it as "Rev 5 - 3/27/01".  Everything else is identical to the draft circulated March 12. The second attachment is to be inserted as Exhibit H-2 in the contract. Thanks. (See attached file: Training LM6000.pdf)(See attached file: LV Cogen Gas Turbine Purchase Agreement - Version 5.DOC)
