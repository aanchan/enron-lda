Richard, When you get a minute I would like to catch you up  on these issues.  I think  it is appropriate to get outside counsel to look at the two Westinghouse  issues we have. Thanks, Kay everyone - greetings. the attached letters are drafts for your review and comment.  we'll clean up  the transmittal with letterhead at time of sending. our intent is to send these two letters to siemens westinghouse asap. plz respond with comments asap. regards.  scott.
