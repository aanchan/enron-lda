I trust  you will find it in order, and would appreciate a confirmation at your  earliest convenience. Kay's extension is 713-345-7566. Thanks much. Ben Jacoby Ben, Thanks for replying so fast.  My numbers are: office 281-457-8444 fax 281-452-1585 cell 713-806-3908 I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards, David Davis Lee, I've notified Ben Jacoby who will be responsible for formal notification from ENA to proceed on the additional dual fuel units.  I'm relatively certain that ENA wants to proceed with these, and I've advised them that GE needs the answer this week--by Friday. Tell David to expect to hear from Ben shortly. Thanks! Mike
