Fine by me. Please review the following and advise me if this Friday is acceptable.   Thanks, Warren. 		 Warren it is ok with me but you need to first check with your direct reports  and see what they say. Thanks Margaret Good Morning Margaret, I wanted to get your permission to come in by 9a.m. this Friday, April 13,  2001.  I have been asked to preach that morning for my church's Passion  Service.  Passion Service begins at 6a.m.  I should be up preaching by 6:45.   It is very possible that I could be finished around 8a.m.  However, just in  case things move slow, I may need the 9a.m time.  Passion Service reflects  the crucifixion, death, and burial of Jesus Christ. Please advise me. Thanks in advance, Warren.
