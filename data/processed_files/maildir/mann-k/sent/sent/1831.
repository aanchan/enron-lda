    	 	 	 Ben This is the letter that Bob Long from Coral Energy sent me.  I asked him if  Shell would be a guarantor for Coral's debts, but he said that, no, Shell  does not guarantee the debts, but instead provides the liquidity that Coral  Energy needs in order to pay them. Rebecca As discussed Coral Energy LLC is 100% (direct/indirect) owned subsidiary of Shell Oil Company ("Shell").  As in the ordinary course of business Shell provides liquidity support to its wholly owned subsidiaries. Given the short term nature of this obligation we would hope that you concur that there is little risk in accepting this Guaranty from Coral Energy LLC. Regards, Robert E.
