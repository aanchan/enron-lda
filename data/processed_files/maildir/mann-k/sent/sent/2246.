We discussed this with Mike last night.  He is going to get the number for  us, as it is buried in a data sheet somewhere. Kay I've already made the change to the CA Energy Development/ABB Agreement. All we're waiting for is guidance on Exhibit A. cc: Can I release a preliminary draft to Alan? Peter--I saw the breakout contract for the CA project that you sent out. Could you send me the current draft, in whatever shape it's in, for the Fountain Valley ABB contract?  I need whatever you have first thing tomorrow ( for dealing with NEPCo, our EPC contractor to arrive at a final EPC contract price, not for dealing with GE or E-Next Generation LLC). Thanks. Al Larsen
