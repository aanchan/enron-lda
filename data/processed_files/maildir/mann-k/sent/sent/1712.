Well I say book all three nights if the cancellation policy is ok, and let's  go for it.  Jack to the doggie spa, Michael with Paige. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, the 26, 27 and 28. cc: Not at all! I forgot to ask you about The Box this morning when we talked on the phone. I will make sure it's put together tonight, but not sealed if there are any last minute items that come to mind, and take it to the post office tomorrow morning. I will call and make reservations after checking the cancellation policy. What days do you want, or should we wait to hear back from Paige? cc: Hi, You must be busy these days.  I remember this time of year - and I don't really miss it.  Cleaning and exercising were my favorite procrastination activities. Neil and I would like to schedule a brief Neil and Kay vacation over the holidays.  We are looking at December 27-30, so we would be back before New Year's Eve.  We will pay you handsomely (in cash!!!) for keeping Michael for those days/nights.  What do you think?  We have found a room at the Inn Above Onion Creek.  I know Michael would be so excited to spend the time with you. We can give you guys a generous allowance to make things easier, and you can drive the Lexus. Do I sound like I'm begging yet?  I'm working really hard these days, and a few days of no responsibilities sounds GREAT. You should start watching your box at the end of the week.  Hope it gets there before Saturday, since I know the SU post office is closed. Love, Mom
