Please see if there is any way we can have it in the same elevator bank.  I  will ask to have it on 29, so you won't need to check there. Hope you've had a great weekend.  The weather was PERFECT!!!! Kay The meeting will be held at 9am in EB20C2.   		  Please see if you can get a conference room, allowing 2 hours for the meeting. Thanks, Kay     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 How does everybody look for a discussion concerning the VEPCO interconnection  agreement on Tuesday, Sept 19? I've checked with Christi, Mitch and Reagan, so they don't need to confirm. Details to follow... Thanks, Kay
