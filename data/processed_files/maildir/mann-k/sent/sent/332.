Ed, Although this email was directed to EI lawyers, I was under the impression  that this was a Corp policy.  Maybe I was wrong. Kay Dianne Langeland The following is just a reiteration of the Legal Department's procedure for  handling Consulting and/or Service Agreements.  Attached are the current  authorized approval forms for these types of agreements. All executed consulting/service agreements should be sent to my attention in  Contract Compliance & Administration Department for input into the Legal  Database, filing and archiving.  Please direct any comments or questions  regarding this procedure to me.  I am located at 3AC-1989 and my extension is  6-7213.   The policy for handling consultant agreements and fee payments is as follows:  (1) The Consulting Agreement must have prior approval as indicated by the  attached Consultant Approval Form before execution by the parties.      (Agreements which were entered into prior to August 8, 1999, required Joe  Sutton's approval rather than the Regional CEO.)        (2) The fully executed agreement along with the approval form is then sent  to Contract Compliance & Administration in the Legal Department to                                  my attention for inputting into the Legal  Database.  (3) Typically,  the consultant fees are not paid until the above has been  accomplished.     The policy for handling service contracts and fee payments is essentially the  same.    (1) The Service Contract must have prior approval as indicated by the  attached Service Contract Approval Form before execution by the parties.   (Agreements which were entered into prior to August 8, 1999 required Joe  Sutton's approval rather than the Regional CEO.)     (2) The fully executed agreement along with the approval is then sent to  Contract Compliance & Administration in the Legal Department (now to my    attention) for inputting into the Legal Database.  (3) As with Consulting Agreement, typically,  the service contract fees are  not paid until the above has been accomplished. When we receive the fully executed agreement, along with fully executed  approval form, we will enter into the Legal Database.  We are unable to do so  without these documents. If you have any questions regarding the above, please do not hesitate to call  me. Thanks, Dianne x6-7213
