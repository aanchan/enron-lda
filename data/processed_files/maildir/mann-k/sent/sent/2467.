This needs to be "TurboParked" (parties changed, GFinance advised).  Is there  any special deal on payment for the change order? I'll figure out how to change the signature lines, etc. Kay Chris:   Are we already paying GE for the change order? Is GE pushing to have this  resolved? Pending input from Kay, I would like to hold off documenting it  until we deal with the contract assignment and ultimate disposition of the  unit. Please follow up with Kay. Thanks, Ben Chris, On behalf of Matt Tezyk, please find attached below the Blue Dog Change Order  for ENA's signature.  This had fallen through the cracks and Matt said that  you would be handling it for me.  Thank you very much. Once ENA has signed off on two (2) originals of the Change Order, you may  return them to me at 3AC 712A.  I will then forward them to Jeffrey Darst for  his signature.  Copies of the fully executed change order will be distributed  upon return from GE. Renee Alfaro Phone: 713-646-7281 Fax: 713-646-6158
