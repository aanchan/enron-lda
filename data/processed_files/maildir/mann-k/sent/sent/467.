Will you be in Friday?  If so, could you help me remember to pick up my  parking card.  I FINALLY got a slot at the Met. Thanks, Kay Parking & Transportation We now have parking spaces available at the Metropolitan Garage, which is  right next to the Allen Center garage, for $69.00 per month, payroll  deduction. If you are interested, please reply via e-mail by 5:00 p.m.,  Thursday, August 17. Your access card will be ready for pick-up on Friday, August 18. If you are currently parking in a garage subsidized by Enron, you will need  to turn in that access card before you get a Metropolitan access card. You  will be able to get out of your current garage. DeShonda x3-6399
