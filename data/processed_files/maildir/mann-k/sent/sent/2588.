Suzanne is out today, so would you mind finding this document and having  someone fax it to me?  I'll email my fax number to you. Much Grass, Kay Kay Mann Hi. There's a document in my O drive directory called kendallsale, or something  close.  I can't remember where I put it - probably under General LOI.  Could  you email it to me? Thanks, Kay
