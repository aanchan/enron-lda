Anytime in the next hour is good, since I didn't eat breakfast.  I would love  a caffeine free Diet Coke. ckm That does sound good.  When do you want it?  Now?  Do you have a Diet Coke? 		 An Antoines tuna and some jalapeno chips sounds good.  I can give you my  badge and you can charge it.   Thanks, Kay What would you like and when do you want it?  I'll go down and get you  something. 		  Is it possible for you to arrange for me to get a sandwich or something for  lunch?  I'm stuck on this call.
