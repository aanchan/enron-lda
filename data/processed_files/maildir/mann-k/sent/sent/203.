I just received this so I wanted to pass it along.  I'll work through the  comments and get back to you with any questions. Kay Kay:  I just received your voice mail message.  I sent the attached memo to my client yesterday.  Why don't you review it and then give me a call back to discuss it.  I will be here all day today, but out tomorrow until late afternoon.  Look forward to talking with you.  <<Memo to Raber re ENRON Option.DOC  - Memo to Raber re ENRON Option.DOC
