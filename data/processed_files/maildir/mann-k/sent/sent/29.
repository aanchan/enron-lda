FYI.  Talking tomorrow am is fine.  I have a 900 conference call on another  matter; otherwise, I'm open.     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 I've made some changes, which I thought I would circulate internally for  comment before sending to GE.   I left Jeff Smith a voice mail asking how the initial payment is supposed to  be split between the on and offshore contracts since this document references  payments to both.   Comments? Kay
