FYI.  I believe we need your help with preparing the first two breakout  contracts - one for the City of Austin project, and one for the ESA project.   I heard yesterday that they want the ESA contract by November 22, and the COA  shortly thereafter. I expect to talk to Kent today about where we are on the form, and how to  move forward to closure.
