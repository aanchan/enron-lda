This is the form which needs to be cleaned up.  I may have a cleaned up  version.  I'll check. Kay Here you go.  It's pretty specific to the Pastoria contract, but has been  blessed by Mike Barnas (subject, of course, to GE getting what they want on a  guaranty!!!  grrrr). Hi Karen, Could I get a copy of whatever the latest version is of the GE consent for  Pastoria?  We have a potential deal coming up to move some frames out of  TurboPark, so I would like to see the current state-of-the-are version. Thanks, Kay
