Hi Bobby, Ok, here's another detail:  what's your web address? Maybe Annie and Katie can come for a visit when things settle down.  I know  Michael would be delighted. We could take them to the Pink House, if they  preferred. Neil and I have talked about wanting them to visit for awhile. I realize there are lots of detail to attend to in the next several weeks.   If there's anything I can do, please let me know. You and your family stay in our thoughts and prayers. I can't imagine what  you, your dad and sister must be going through. I can relate to Katie and  Annie, though, as the loss of each of my grandparents caused me a lot of  sadness. I know they were close to your mom, and spent a lot of time with  her.  What a wonderful gift of memories they must have, and what joy they  must have brought to her life. Love to all, Kay Hey Kay -  Presbyterian. I'll have a map up on our web site later this evening.     I think Annie needs to stay with us for a few days. As good as that sounds for Lisa and me, she's pretty upset at times (last night was the first night she was able to sleep by herself).     Thank you for your thoughts and concerns, and your cards, and for talking with Lisa. It was tough for her being away from everything, and she really needed you and your mom and dad. And I don't think I've ever been so glad to be home as I was yesterday. Thanks again, and please give my love to your family (including your your executive in training) - Bobby cc:  Hi Kay!  Thank you so much for sending us the cards. We have already gotten them. I  hope that Paige is having a good birthday. Please tell that I have not  forgotten it!  The memorial will be here in Austin at 1 on Saturday. Bobby and his family  want people to come here after for the traditional food thing. It should  okay. Our house is a light brighter and open than his dad's.  Anyway. Just wanted to say thanks and tell you that I enjoyed talking with  you on the phone the other day.  Kiss your family for me.  Love you!  Lisa
