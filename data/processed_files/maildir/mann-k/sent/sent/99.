We are very early in the process on this one, so you haven't missed out on  any opportunities! Kay 		  I attach the new draft of the Agency Agreement I received from Peoples a few  moments ago. Simon Helfrich called to comment on the credit provisions.  The essence of  their proposal is that the LLC acts as a guarantor of all accounts receivable  from parties for whom the LLC has performed the credit check. I look forward to discussing this draft with you. Thanks!  DT  RE: Agency Agreement David: Attached for MEH's review is a redlined draft of the Agency Agreement.
