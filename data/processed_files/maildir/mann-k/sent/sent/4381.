Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think we've done that on the other two deals.   Kathleen would know. For the escrow.  Unfortunately, Citibank's form contained the following language in the signature block: "In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my 2001." Kathleen: Paul Hastings would like ENA to resign the Incumbency Certificate, since the original Certificate did not affix the corporate seal.  Could you coordinate this and make sure the seal is affixed to the new Certificate?  Thanks. Call me if you have any questions.
