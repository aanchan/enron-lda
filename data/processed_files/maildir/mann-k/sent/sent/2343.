Please locate Jody Pierce's fax number, and send it to Peter. Thanks, Kay What is Jody's fax #? cc: 01:55 Kay Mann cc: Viola! 01:50 Kay Mann cc: Lee, The best way to go about it would be to send the invoice to Jody, but copy the Enron project folks you have been dealing with. Are we ready to sign the Fountain Valley contract?  I would think that we could sign the change order at the same time, and payment terms can be whatever the Enron project team has bought in to.  The banks won't care. Have you seen sig pages for ESA yet? Kay cc: Kay, Please confirm that this will be the invoicing address for the 6 units bound for Fountain Valley Project and 4 units pegged to LV Cogen Expansion. Also, we've still got a change order needed for Fountain Valley for the 6 Power System Stabilizers and 2 Exhaust Stacks.  LV is also saying they will need 4 Power System Stabilizers, but haven't confirmed their order. Thanks, Lee E-Next Generation LLC Mr. Jody Pierce 1400 Smith, EB 2480 Houston, Tx 77002
