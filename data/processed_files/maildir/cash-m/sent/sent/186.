Here is the thing I have edited. Michelle 		 Thanks, Sharon.  The GIS version just adds a view words from the employment  application alerting employees not to 'overstate' their education, skills,  experience, etc. Sharon Butcher Dear Sherry:  I provided the SAP version which is similar to the one on the  Corporate LAN.  I will have Mark Holsworth and Kriste Sullivan provide their  comments.  Thanks.   Sharon Sherry Lessner We are working on a single logon process through HR On-Line that will enable  employees to utilize functionality in SAP Employee Self Service and HR-GIS  without having to be concerned about which system to use.  I am attaching the  security warning messages from both systems for your review.  Andrea and I  believe it would be best to combine these statements and would appreciate  your assistance in doing so.  Michelle, as you will recall, you helped us  with the statement for HR-GIS.  I do not know who provided the SAP version,  but it seems more similar to the general one on the Corporate LAN. Please let me know if one of you can assist us with this.  We are under a  pretty tight time crunch with July 1 looming fairly closely.  Thank you for  your consideration and help!
