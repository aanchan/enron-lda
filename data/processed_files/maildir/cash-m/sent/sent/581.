FYI re:  FMLA policy Michelle Cash Sharon/Kriste, If there are going to be revisions to the leave policy, I suggest that we  make major ones, including a segregation of FMLA leave from other types of  Majorly important!! Michelle Dear Michelle and Kriste:   Please review and let me have your comments.    Thanks.  Sharon Elaine Paul Here are a few edits to the Approved Time Off and Leaves of Absence policy. Benefits has not included a "second or third opinion by another health care  provider paid for by the Company" as it has significant implications to our  LTD plan and has created at least one problem that I am aware of in the past. We will need to think through what the certification document might look like  and would look to you for some guidelines.   The concern I have is around  privacy and use of information given potential regulation. Cynthia believes that we should run FMLA concurrent with sick time.  I agree  and have noted that in the document.    Sharon, could you please review the wording to ensure I haven't missed  something here from a legal perspective.  I will follow-up with you by phone  shortly.   Susan, here are the "long-since promised" wording changes we propose.      Thanks, Elaine
