Patrick, do you have any comments to this?  Michelle Kari Oquinn As we had talked about last week, I'd appreciate if you would have the  attached document (proposed IT Retention Equity program) reviewed for legal  purposes.  Particular attention needs to be paid to the area that addresses  employees on leave of absence.  The excel document includes 3 worksheets  which are the attachments to the Write-Up.
