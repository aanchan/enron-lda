More info about Bond.  Michelle Michelle, This is Scott Williamson's reponses. I talked with him about the number of  times he travels out of the US for work and he said for Enron he has and will  not travel for work. For Conchango he does. Right now he is in the UK trying  to get his visa situation straightened out?? I don't know what that means. Mandy 1. I need Steve until I'm able to hire someone to fulfill that role.  We are  actively recruiting and interviewing candidates for his activities. 2. I simply do not have an answer for your second question. We have not  discussed or agreed upon a set number of trips. Scott 		  Scott, Once again we need some more information about Stephen Bond. How long will he  be here? and how many trips in and out of the US will he make? Please let me  know as soon as possible so we can bring this to a conclusion. Thanks Scott!! Mandy
