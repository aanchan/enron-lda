Twadna, would you please print and then file Ecogas (not due diligence file)  for me.  Thanks a lot.  Michelle 	Randal Maffett 		  	 Attached is my draft of what we discussed.  I'm trying to get w/  Bowen/Donahue to discuss ASAP and will keep you posted accordingly.  Let me  know ASAP if you have any comments, edits, etc... Thanks for all your help today and thru all the other issues, etc...  It's  been invaluable and I sincerely appreciate your patience as I learn more of  how to deal with the legal aspects of all this. RANDY
