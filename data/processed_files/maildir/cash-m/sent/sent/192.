Twanda, would you please print this and also the attachment -- with the  notes?  Thanks.  MHC 	Jane Allen 		  I have prepared the attached and forwarded to Drew Lynch.  I am meeting with  him today.  From my understanding, he agrees with the attached, so we can  move forward with the payback letter.  Can you assist? Thanks, Jane     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 I agree but there is still no policy in place.  We need to develop a  mechanism for charging the green cards as well.  Can you assist me with  drafting something that I can get the individuals to sign?  We currently have  about 25 in process. Thanks, Jane Michelle Cash Jane, When the Green Card Task Force was alive, we discussed a payback provision if  the person left within two years after receiving a green card (voluntarily).   Is this being done?  If not, I think we should talk about it, given all the  time, energy, resources, funds, etc., being expended on getting a person a  green card. Michelle
