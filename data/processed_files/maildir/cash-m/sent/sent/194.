Hi, Linda.   I am not surprised; she sent me an email, too.  I was out on  vacation last week, so I only gave Kim my feedback early this week.  I hope  that ELM has received the response by now.  Let me know if I need to do  anything else.  Michelle 		  Hi Michelle. Unfortunately, this issue with Eddie Lynn Morgan is still alive.  I talked with Kim a few weeks ago and she mentioned that she sent her  write-up to you for your review - before sending it to Eddie Lynn. Do you  have a status update on when it will be ready to go to Eddie Lynn? Thanks Michelle! 	Lynn Morgan 		  It has now been two weeks since Kim said she would send me a note and yet no  response.  Perhaps now you can see my continued frustration with the lack of  response to what I consider to be a very serious matter.   As you had  suggested when we first talked, I would appreciate it if you would forward  this to Kim's boss so that I can get a response.

As you indicated, she had not had an  opportunity to provide you with the final outcome of the email investigation.  She apologizes for this and will have a write up to you within 1 week from  today. Let me know if you don't receive it by next Wednesday.  thanks.
