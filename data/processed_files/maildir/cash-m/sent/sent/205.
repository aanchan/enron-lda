Twanda, please print.  Thanks.  MHC 		  Michelle, John, Attached please find the draft check-list I prepared per your  requests.  I utilized a variety of legal memorandums and topic reference in  developing this.  In the many instances listed,  the consensus from both  NEPCO and ECC should be paramount.  Please let me know if  there are topics  you would clarify.  I believe we were going to attempt a joint discussion  after receipt and review of this draft.   I have good availability for a  conference discussion on: I will be trying to vacation in the interim periods.  Thanks,  I'll look  forward to your comments.  Rj.
