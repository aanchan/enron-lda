Fran, I am not sure that I ever had an executed document on the loans.  By copy of  this email, I am asking Twanda to send you what she has that has been signed  by Dosier.  I will let you fight the payment battles!

Fran L Mayes 		  Michelle, I do not have a copy of the executed document.   Can you provide me  with the amount due so that I can issue instructions - is this through A/P or  payroll (with taxes withheld). Fran Hi Fran, Wade Dosier is now in EBS and informed me that he has a forgiveable loan from  ENA.  He asked me to make sure that the funds were being processed and that  they were being paid by ENA.  Can you please confirm?  thanks
