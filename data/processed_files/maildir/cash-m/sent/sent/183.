Talk with Mary McKendrey (may be spelled wrong), or Pam Butler in corporate  comp. 		  Can you remind me who handles the AESOP information -- I will be passing the  name on to Peggy Determeyer, as noted below. L, T Peggy Determeyer Do you have the name and phone number of the person who handles the options?   I checked my statement, and no options were credited for yearend 1999. Thanks, Peggy
