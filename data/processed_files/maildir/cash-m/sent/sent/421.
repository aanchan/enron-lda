Laura, do you need any more information from me on this point?  Michelle ENRON         At one point in time, many years ago, we required EDS to have a DOT drug and  alcohol testing program for their DOT-covered employees, who were the IT  people working at our sites, since they were doing the same job as Enron  employees and were considered DOT.  We should probably look carefully at  their current jobs to determine if they are DOT-covered or not.  If they are  performing DOT-covered jobs, their employer should be required to have a DOT  Drug and Alcohol Testing program, if not it is not necessary to test them on  a random basis.  The only random testing this company allows is for  DOT-covered  and safety sensitive employees in NEPCO and OEC.  Also we have  no means to test employees from other companies since our random selection is  accomplished through our payroll system, nor do we want to be in the business  of testing other's employees.   Hope that helps.  Susan T. Susan, The question of random drug testing of non-DOT employees who work  side-by-side with DOT employees has come up (see below).  My understanding is  that we do not do random tests except for DOT personnel.  First, am I  correct?  Second, have we ever done random testing in this type of  situation?  Your experience would be helpful. Thanks. Michelle Michelle, could you please review the correspondence below.  Thanks. Laura, Sounds like they have a precedence for doing it.  This is a question for  Michelle Cash.     I would not test non-Dot employees unless there was a  significant reason.   However, I have worked in a DOT environment and  understand the desire to test them all.   I don't think it is good practice. Gary     Gary, what is your opinion of non-DOT employees being subject to random drug  tests?  This IT department supports the Gas Controllers,  who are subject to  random drug tests.  My only concern is if we enforce this policy with one IT  group and not the rest of the group, is that fair?   Laura Wilkinson Gary, I am going to look into this and get back to you once I have researched  this question.  Thanks. Gary Kenagy During the EDS to Enron transition I asked about getting the IT staff  supporting Gas Control into the random drup testing program within Enron. Per  the transition agreement, EDS had continued the program with an external drug  testing vendor after we were outsourced to EDS back in 1985. We need to get  our staff into the Enron internal program. Not everyone in my group is  effected, but most are. I've listed the names below. The Gas Control support  staff is framiliar with the program and aware that they are required to  participate. I haven't heard anything about it from anyone since the  transition back to Enron so I am assuming this slipped through the cracks. The staff listed below all support Gas Control, have access to the SCADA  systems, and could have significant impact to the operation of the  applications used in Gas Control to monitor and control the pipeline.  Thanks, Gary Basha, Clifford Kenagy, Gary Little, Steve Margoliner, George Marshall, George Moore, Michael Hagen, Robert Poole, Kenneth Thompson, Rodney Sayegh, Angela Smith, Mike (new hire) Rodriguez, Ruben TBD (Vasu Sashti) TBD (Tracey Brown)
