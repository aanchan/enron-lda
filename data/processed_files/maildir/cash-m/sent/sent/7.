Dan, what is the status of this deal?  I hadn't heard anything for a few  days, and I knew we were on a tight time frame.  Thanks.  Michelle FYI Kathy, Here is Wayne's response to the HR due diligence questions that Michelle  proposed.  What are your thoughts?  Let me know what you need, and I will  push him for adequate answers.  I will forward you the e-mail of the employee  manual.  In addition, I believe Maribel Mata in due diligence has a hard copy  of Power System's employee manual; you may call her and see if you can get it  (I left her a message letting her know you may be calling her). Thanks, John H. John, This list relates to an acquisition which is not the case.  I think you're all set from the benefit information we are giving you.  I'll have Lori email you the employee manual (you have it in hard copy already). Wayne (See attached file: 2000duediligencewksheet.doc)
