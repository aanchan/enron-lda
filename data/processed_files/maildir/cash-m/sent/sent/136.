Twanda, would you please make this change to all forms?  Thank you.  Michelle Michelle, We found another change for the employment agreement language.  The reference  to the full name of the Admin Committee should read "the Administrative  Committee of the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the  Enron Corp. Board of Directors."   Thanks, Courtney
