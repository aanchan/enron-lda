Rick,  It sounds like this may satisfy CURE, but I question whether this is  an appropriate payment.  I would want to touch base with the lawyers working  on the deal to find out if there are any implications.  Any other feedback?   Michelle   Please review and comment on the attached inter-office memorandum, as soon as  possible.  Thanks Rj
