great, Andrea, shall we discuss rollout asap?  Thanks!!  Michelle I'm comfortable with this approach. Andrea,  I don't think we need a certification.  I suggest an email mailout, with the  policy residing on the hr web site.  It would be a good idea to place a link  to the policy on all pages that involve HR data, such as PEP, comp data base,  SAP HR, etc. Brian, what do you think? Michelle Do you need any type of certification that the employee has read and accepts  like the "Certificate of Compliance"?  Can we put it on the front page of  ehronline and HROL?  Should this just be an email mailout?  Should this  reside on the hrwebsite? Andrea, Brian and I were talking about the dissemination of this policy.  It seems as  if it should come from your group and go out globally.  What do you think? Michelle Michelle Cash Attached is a revised draft of the Employee Data Protection Policy, which is  required because of directives by the European Union. Please provide me with any questions or comments on this policy. I would appreciate any comments by Monday, September 11, 2000 so that this  policy can be rolled out quickly. Thank you. Michelle Cash
