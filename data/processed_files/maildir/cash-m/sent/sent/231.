T;  please print this and any attachments and file under "Japan --  Pre-Employment Testing."  Thanks! 		  John Our team does not know the answer off hand but we will check and come back in  a couple of days. Regards Paul Davis                                          Japan(Document link: John                                          Viverito) John, Thanks for including me on the distribution of this -- I received your voice mail and was glad to be in the loop. In general, we try to avoid any type of personality/psych testing because of issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits pre-employment medical testing.  It does apply to US citizens working for Enron in foreign locations (i.e. extraterritorially). Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertain the purpose/goal of the tests.  Why do they want this information?  Is there another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g., references from prior employers, etc.)? As noted below, there may be Japanese labor/employment law issues that address this type of activity as well.  I suggest that we obtain the information above as well as the opinion requested below and then determine how to proceed. Michelle                     John Michelle- Pursuant to my voicemail, I am forwarding the attached e-mail traffic for your consideration.  I am unsure as to the types of testing contemplated, but want to ensure that such activities are permitted under Enron's policy. Your comments on the attached agreement would also be appreciated. Thanks, John                     Phillip                     -SYDNEY-              cc:                     05/10/2000 Hi John   Enron will be using PDI in Tokyo for candidate abilities testing prior to employment.  The outcome of the testing is a confidential report that comes to me (as HR) and I then send to the participant(s) in the recruitment decision making process for their confidential consumption.  PDI have agreed to me doing this via email, however are seeking some reassurance as to our use of and maintenance of confidentiality of the final product.  Can you review the attached and come back to me with your thoughts?  I would also appreciate a local (Japan) opinion on the legal issues associated with abilities/psych testing prior to employment (I know you guys shy away from it in the US although it is quite widely accepted "down under"). Thanks and regards Phil Phil, With the e-mail transmission (using .pdf files), we'll need you or someone else in Enron to sign a document similar to the attached letter. Please read it and let me know if you want to make any changes before we fill in all the details. Thanks very much, Douglas (See attached file: emailrelease.doc)
