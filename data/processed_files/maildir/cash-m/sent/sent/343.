Andrea, Brian and I were talking about the dissemination of this policy.  It seems as  if it should come from your group and go out globally.  What do you think? Michelle Michelle Cash Attached is a revised draft of the Employee Data Protection Policy, which is  required because of directives by the European Union. Please provide me with any questions or comments on this policy. I would appreciate any comments by Monday, September 11, 2000 so that this  policy can be rolled out quickly. Thank you. Michelle Cash
