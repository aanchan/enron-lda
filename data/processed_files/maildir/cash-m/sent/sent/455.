I'll take care of it today.  Michelle Karen E Jones Michelle, Sam told me that Gene Tackett and Kathy Russeth have approved the form of  consulting agreements you prepared, and everyone is ready to sign.  Please  send initialled, execution copies to Sam, and we will have Dave Parquet sign  them.  I need to request urgency on this, as the documents are relevant (from  a due diligence perspective) to our larger Pastoria transaction.  Thanks.
