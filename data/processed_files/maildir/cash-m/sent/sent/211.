Jane, I was not involved -- I think Sharon was.  Michelle 	Jane Allen 		  Do either of you have a copy of Dennis Pick's employment agreement which  contains the provisions of his severance?  The UK Inland Revenue is making  inquiries and needs a copy. Jane Victoria McCarthy Dear Jane I have just joined Enron, and will be assisting Tara Rozen and Madeline Fox  with their expat work. We have recently had an enquiry from the UK Inland Revenue regarding Dennis  Pick's termination payment.  They have asked that we supply them with a copy  of Dennis's original contract of employment (we have the letter of assignment  on file, but this is not sufficient for their enquiry).  Do you know a contact who we could request the contract from? Thanks for your help. Victoria
