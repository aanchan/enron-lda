They've all been changed. Sorry for the delay. Chaos! Kate Rhonda L Denton Please change to Power Marketing.  Edward Sacks in credit has indicated that  it should be them.  Thanks. I just spoke with Sean Crandall, the trader on these deals, and he said the  counterparty could be either Conoco Pipeline Co. or Conoco Power Marketing.  If credit has specified the latter, I'll change these deals. Just let me know. Thanks, Kate Rhonda L Denton Credit called me and believes the following deals should be booked to Conoco  Power Marketing.  Can you check on them for me and let me know?  I appreciate  it. 507417 507430 506549 506550 506551 Gracias!!
