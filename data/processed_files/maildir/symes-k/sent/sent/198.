I don't know if you saw my second e-mail, but I checked it out with Chris  Mallory, who did the deal, and he verified the price at $214.95. If Prebon  still disputes this, let me know and I'll have Mallory talk to Prebon. Thanks, Kate Kate Prebon shows $114.95 as the price and we show $214.95 This is actually deal #471975, which I just fixed because Jeff forgot to put  the broker name in there. It is with Prebon. Thanks, Kate JEff Richter Prebon sent over a statement where: Enron buys from EES 12/5-12/30 25 mw of SP-15 at $114.95
