I'm so glad to hear it! Cara suspected it was an EOL bug that had since been  fixed. Thanks for clarifying this. Kate Hello Cara, We have determined that the EOL Bridge in production is currently working and  handling time zone issue very well. Back in June 2000, there is a bug, which related to time zone issue and we  fixed it since then. All deals that you provided to us had entered before July 2000. We will run a query to identify if there are any other deals, which have  similar problem with time zone. Please let me know if you find more problems with EOL Bridge, we will fix it  immediately. Your help is highly appreciated Regards, dluu  	 I just ran a forward ob for April 2 to check for deals that are in PST when  they should be PDT.    Do you want to change all of these to PPT deals, or do you have time  constraints today?  I need these changed today because we are already setting  up for April.
