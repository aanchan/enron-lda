Geir zeroed deal 581368, and added deal 592672. There is another deal  corresponding with this that completes the path from Four Corners to NP-15.  Please let me know if you see this come through. Thanks, Kate Rhonda L Denton Can you kill this deal or zero out the volumes?  thanks. I just spoke with Jesse Bryson in Real Time, and he said this should actually  be 2 buy-resales - one from Four Corners to ZP-26, and one from ZP-26 to  NP-15. Let me know how that sounds to you, and I'll enter the deals. Thanks, Kate Rhonda L Denton Should this be NCPA, since we do not have transmission with them.  Or maybe  it should be a buy/resale.  let me know.  Thanks.
