    	 	 	 power/role of women  A Thought For Christmas  Do you know what would have happened if it had been  Three Wise Women instead of Three Wise Men?  They would have asked directions,  Arrived on time,  Helped deliver the baby,  Cleaned the stable,  Made a casserole,  Brought practical gifts and  There would be Peace On Earth.  Pass it on to the wise women in your life! -- Maria E.
