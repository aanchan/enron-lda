Chris - Would you mind e-mailing Evelyn your contact information at the APX? And I  can't recall whether or not we wanted to confirm these trades. Let me know  when you get a chance, and I'll take care of it with the Confirms group. Thanks, Kate Kate, have we started using this brokerage firm yet.  If so, do you have any  phone numbers to contact them?  Also, do you know how we are going to confirm  their trades? Thanks
