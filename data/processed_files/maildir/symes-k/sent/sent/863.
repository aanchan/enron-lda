How crazy would that be if we had three generations of Symes in one  classroom! If I were one of the other students and I figured out there were  three siblings in my class, I might actually consider that a little bizarre,  like a circus family or something. But whatever. I'm definitely into it  though - that is, if U.O. has decided to forgive my errant freshman year  behavior that got me booted from those luxurious residance halls and re-admit  me. They're probably looking over my application right now and just pissing  themselves, "Wait a minute - that good-for-nothing druggy thinks she's going  to GRADUATE SCHOOL...HAHAHAHAHAHA..." and so on.  And by the way, I didn't mean to throw you into a fit of Catholic guilt over  the kitty thing. She's totally fine, and mom actually likes her. I think my  presence actually upsets the balance. And I think this move might be good for  her - she'll be going back to her apartment roots. The real martyr in all of  this is Big Kitty, who still looks completely baffled when Kitty hurtles  herself at him from behind doorways and such. After she does that, they  generally both walk away from each other just looking completely dissatisfied  with the whole thing - Big Kitty because he's old and demented and everything  confuses him, and Kitty because she's young and demented and everything  pisses her off. Gotta love it.  So you look like Jennifer now? Hey, don't underestimate the one-time  popularity of that haircut. Everything comes back into fashion at some point.  I will tell Brett you said hi. His wife just had her baby - they are such a  freaking cute little family it makes me depressed. Even more than I already  am from having to sit around my house all the time and listen to Amber and  Molly call their respective boyfriends "schmoopy" and swap sex stories. It's  thoroughly disgusting, and I've told them so. They just throw their heads  back and laugh with self-satisfied couple-induced mania. And there you have  my happy little family..... Have fun on your date tonight! Just go into it like you have nothing to lose,  which you don't, and like you don't care, which you shouldn't. 'Kay? Love ya, Kate Zero week is a one-week, four-credit course in June at U of O.  I'm trying to get John to do it, too.  Maybe we should all take one together!  Anyway, the website is uosummer.uoregon.edu (no www), but unfortunately none of the info is posted yet because they're all a bunch of lazy pot-smoking superfreaks over there in Eugene.  Usually you can choose from any general ed courses - I'm taking polisci because I need it for my major.  They'll have journalism and stuff like that.  We could crash at John's house and party till the wee hours with all the wee freshmen! I feel bad about Kitty, too.  Is she getting more nuts than ever?  I would love to bring her out here if it wasn't for the obvious obstacles (she could never go outside, she would rip my face off on the ride over, etc.).  If she is still doing bad next year when my lease runs out, we could consider bringing her out here.  I could move into a house.  Anyway, I'm sorry to hear about the whole thing.  I feel really guilty too.  Hopefully Mom is available for the five minutes a day that Kitty actually wants contact with humans. Well, have fun getting your hair cut and tell Brett I said hi!  I got my hair cut here and the man confused me with Jennifer Aniston circa 1990.  I look like a freak, and my hair is oily, and I don't want to go on this date. Have a good night! Anna cc: I'm so glad to hear everything's better at your house!  I totally want to come visit, but my last two paycheck deposits have only raised the balance to $0 so it may be awhile.  I'm definitely coming in June, when I take a zero week class in Eugene.  Mom's supposedly coming out here in April and we might go to Glenwood Springs (hot springs, spa, MASSAGES!).  You should come, too!  Fun female family bonding time! I am so excited for Dad to visit, not just because of the car but also because it will increase my quantity of social engagements by about 100%. I'm a little worried about the effect it's having on Mom, who asked me when he was coming so she wouldn't "run into him".  Like I would allow that to happen - how stupid does she think I am?  But it sounds like she's pretty stoked about this house thing, so I'm excited for her. I have a date with that waiter guy tonight, but I'm not really that excited because I am fat, ugly and on the third day of my period.  Did I mention broke and car-less?  I think I should just put off this whole dating thing until I increase MY net value (to use Kate-speak), which is just ground zero for most people.  I am trying to pay off some debt (Dad took care of most of it, but I didn't have the heart to show him my Nordstrom account).  It's slow-going, though.  And car payments will not make it easy, but seriously this city is so pedestrian-unfriendly that I feel I have no choice.  I tried to go to my tennis lessons the other day and ended up walking along the shoulder of a highway for twenty minutes.  And every person in Denver feels the need to own a dog and allow it to bark menacingly at every passerby (I am SO afraid of dogs after my brush with death in the form of a Doberman). So I need a car,  and I don't care if it means weekly visits to the plasma "donation" center. I actually met Marky's ex the other night (maybe don't mention to Amber - I don't know why but the whole thing seems weird and I would rather stay out of it).  Anyway, she is really cool!  She reminds me of my friend Jen Sturmer, except less anorexic and depressed.  Speaking of, have you been going out in Portland a lot?  I miss Veritable Quandary!  I haven't found anything like that here yet.  Downtown has some cool bars, but you have to pay $90 plus an appendage to park and cabs are not cheap either.  My neighborhood has some good dives, like the one on our corner that has a flickering neon sign outside announcing "Don's Mixed Drinks" - not sure, but think that's the name of the bar.  I went in once and met Don, the king of multiple body piercings here in Denver. Okay, I'm rambling.  Time to get back to work (which is so good lately, by the way!  I get to start grant-writing this month!).  Hope all's well for you.  I'll give you the dirt on my date later, if my acne doesn't scare him away in minute one.  Miss you, love you!! Love, yo sista cc: Hey Lady! What do you think you're doing?  I haven't talked to you in way too long. You have to update me on the sitch!  I am going on a date with a guy I met while out with Monica last weekend.  He was our waiter and he looks like Chandler Bing, only Monica kept calling him Chanandler Bong (did you see that episode when they had to name who the TV Guide came to?).  She is so fun!  I was so glad to get out of my apartment/away from my roommate.  And now I have a date, so I'm excited.  I'm still in contact with Mr. Colorblind, but we've had the friends talk so it's been really cool.  In fact, he's nicer to me now than he was before!  Anyway, that's crazy news about Mom's house!  I guess no more crashing at her house when I go home. How are your roommates?  Your seattle boyfriend?  Your job?  Write me with the goods, woman.  I am getting a car in two weeks and I am more excited than any car-buyer has ever been.  My job is great, although i think I'm getting scoliosis from bad posture in an uncomfortable chair all day. Nothing else is happening.  Are you going out for St. Patrick's Day?  I have to work, but there's a big outdoor thing downtown that I might go to afterwards.  Okay, must go work.  Call me though!  I miss you! Love, Anna
