Another trivial counterparty name change - it's Enmax Energy Corp., not just  plain old Enmax Corp. These deals have been changed. Thanks, Kate Rhonda, You are correct! 540039, 541695, 541715, and 541737 are booked to Enmax Corporation.  I think  they should be booked to Enmax Energy Corporation.  Wendy Conwell in credit  has prepared a credit work sheet on this CP so I believe this is the correct  entity.  Can you check?
