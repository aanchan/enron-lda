This should be the contact information in GCP. If it's not in there, let me  know and I'll have it added. Thanks, Kate Hi Kate! I can't find any contact info. in GCP for these counterparties (California  Dept. of Water Resources, Metro. Water Dist. of Southern Cal., and Atlantic  Richfield Co.)  Can you give me contact names and phone numbers so that i can  get a verbal confirm on these deals? Thanks, Kim H.
