I added the fee - but was wondering why it didn't default to a fee since  Bloomberg is an online trading service. I know they're gone now, but if you  think of it later, you might ask.  Thanks, Kate and one more check Richter deal 550267.01  bloomberg has fee of .005   we have zero, called bloomberg,  no answer  fee? Thanks
