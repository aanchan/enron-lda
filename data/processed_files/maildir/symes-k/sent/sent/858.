Hey - what the heck is zero week? I might be interested in signing up for  that - pack in some quick credits for my pre-grad school work. I figured out  I'm going to essentially have to get a second bachelor's degree before going  to grad school. But hey, it's all about the credentials man - as in, being  able to tell people at my 10-year high school reunion that I have two  bachelor's degrees, a master's, and a Rhodes Scholarship to study Italian  wine in a 12th century villa, surrounded by buff, tan, and unusually  good-looking farm workers.Tres important!  So yeah, maybe we'll hold off on the visit for now. I think it's more  important for us both to feel mentally stable about our finances for right  now - then we party! I could maybe make it out there in April, overlap with  mom's trip (I don't think I could handle the whole thing with her...) - I'll  keep it in mind. And yeah, she's giddy about this whole house move thing. I  hope it works out for the best - I really think it will. I'm starting to feel  really bad about leaving Kitty with her, but I'm in a weird situation with  Amber's cat at our house already. Part of me wants to just bring Kitty over  and tell everyone to deal with it because it's my house too; but the other  part of me doesn't want to deal with the bloodshed that will ensue between  her and Amber's outmatched feline. Oh well, I'm thinking about it.  The most excitement I'll be having this week is my haircut with Brett  tonight. I think I might also be purchasing a bedskirt, a totally extraneous  and disappointing expense that I would never have had if I hadn't insisted on  getting a "real" house with a "real" bed and all that other crap that goes  along with it and inevitably costs you money that you could have otherwise  spent on beer. And as the sands flow, these are the days of our lives.... I'm so impressed with your dating maneuvers. I told Amber and Molly about it  last night at dinner, which we ate together around our new dining room table,  and they both said in unison, "Like sister, like sister." I guess I have some  kind of reputation for ending up on dates with waiters - go figure. Anyway,  it's time for me to go find something to eat and then come back to my desk  and consume it while it flows directly to my butt. Can't wait! Write back  soon. Kate I'm so glad to hear everything's better at your house!  I totally want to come visit, but my last two paycheck deposits have only raised the balance to $0 so it may be awhile.  I'm definitely coming in June, when I take a zero week class in Eugene.  Mom's supposedly coming out here in April and we might go to Glenwood Springs (hot springs, spa, MASSAGES!).  You should come, too!  Fun female family bonding time! I am so excited for Dad to visit, not just because of the car but also because it will increase my quantity of social engagements by about 100%. I'm a little worried about the effect it's having on Mom, who asked me when he was coming so she wouldn't "run into him".  Like I would allow that to happen - how stupid does she think I am?  But it sounds like she's pretty stoked about this house thing, so I'm excited for her. I have a date with that waiter guy tonight, but I'm not really that excited because I am fat, ugly and on the third day of my period.  Did I mention broke and car-less?  I think I should just put off this whole dating thing until I increase MY net value (to use Kate-speak), which is just ground zero for most people.  I am trying to pay off some debt (Dad took care of most of it, but I didn't have the heart to show him my Nordstrom account).  It's slow-going, though.  And car payments will not make it easy, but seriously this city is so pedestrian-unfriendly that I feel I have no choice.  I tried to go to my tennis lessons the other day and ended up walking along the shoulder of a highway for twenty minutes.  And every person in Denver feels the need to own a dog and allow it to bark menacingly at every passerby (I am SO afraid of dogs after my brush with death in the form of a Doberman). So I need a car,  and I don't care if it means weekly visits to the plasma "donation" center. I actually met Marky's ex the other night (maybe don't mention to Amber - I don't know why but the whole thing seems weird and I would rather stay out of it).  Anyway, she is really cool!  She reminds me of my friend Jen Sturmer, except less anorexic and depressed.  Speaking of, have you been going out in Portland a lot?  I miss Veritable Quandary!  I haven't found anything like that here yet.  Downtown has some cool bars, but you have to pay $90 plus an appendage to park and cabs are not cheap either.  My neighborhood has some good dives, like the one on our corner that has a flickering neon sign outside announcing "Don's Mixed Drinks" - not sure, but think that's the name of the bar.  I went in once and met Don, the king of multiple body piercings here in Denver. Okay, I'm rambling.  Time to get back to work (which is so good lately, by the way!  I get to start grant-writing this month!).  Hope all's well for you.  I'll give you the dirt on my date later, if my acne doesn't scare him away in minute one.  Miss you, love you!! Love, yo sista cc: Hey Lady! What do you think you're doing?  I haven't talked to you in way too long. You have to update me on the sitch!  I am going on a date with a guy I met while out with Monica last weekend.  He was our waiter and he looks like Chandler Bing, only Monica kept calling him Chanandler Bong (did you see that episode when they had to name who the TV Guide came to?).  She is so fun!  I was so glad to get out of my apartment/away from my roommate.  And now I have a date, so I'm excited.  I'm still in contact with Mr. Colorblind, but we've had the friends talk so it's been really cool.  In fact, he's nicer to me now than he was before!  Anyway, that's crazy news about Mom's house!  I guess no more crashing at her house when I go home. How are your roommates?  Your seattle boyfriend?  Your job?  Write me with the goods, woman.  I am getting a car in two weeks and I am more excited than any car-buyer has ever been.  My job is great, although i think I'm getting scoliosis from bad posture in an uncomfortable chair all day. Nothing else is happening.  Are you going out for St. Patrick's Day?  I have to work, but there's a big outdoor thing downtown that I might go to afterwards.  Okay, must go work.  Call me though!  I miss you! Love, Anna
