They are good deals, but we don't have deal numbers because Mike is out of  the office right now and said he wanted to check with the broker personally  before verifying the price. He's aware that the deals will have to go in late  and be backdated, and that they will not be in his calculation for the day.  Please let me know if there's anything else I can do. Kate Are these good deals for Mike?  Evelyn Metoyer Can you check Mike Swerzbin for the following deals through Prebon: Enron sells Sempra 50 mw of Sept.'01  Mid-C at $360.00 Enron buys Sempra 50 mw of July '01 Mid-C at $270.00 Thanks!!
