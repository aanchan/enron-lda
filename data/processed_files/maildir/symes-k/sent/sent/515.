The Prebon broker was pulling his tapes this morning when I asked Chris about  it - he said he'd let me know as soon as they worked it out. I just checked  with Chris again, and apparently the broker pulled tapes from the wrong day.  But we should know soon. I'll e-mail you right away. Kate Kate what is the status of this deal? Chris Mallory and the Prebon broker are currently debating this price. I'll  let you know when they settle it. Thanks, Kate Chris Mallory Deal 512609 Prebon shows price as $165....Enpower has $160.
