Here's the latest I've heard from Willie Harrell, the Global Management staff  member in charge of this job. I spoke with him briefly, and he said he  expected to have the indices available in Enpower this afternoon.  Jeff Richter is currently consumed with sorting out EES discrepancies for  today, but we'll work on the new spreadsheets this afternoon. I'll keep you posted. Thanks, Kate     	 	 	 I am currently awaiting the curve codes to be set-up in Enpower pub posting.   Rates will be posted curve codes are created.  Thanks,  wlh
