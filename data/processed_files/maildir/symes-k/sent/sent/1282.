Did Chris Foster ever get back to you on this? I had asked him to let you  know when he found out, but I wanted to make sure the information actually  got passed along. Let me know when you get a moment. Thanks, Kate Rhonda L Denton FYI.  Please let us know if we will be receiving broker paper in Houston or  will it come to Portland? Jason Moore The counterparty has been linked to the Power Broker - Houston Group. Jason Moore Rhonda L Denton Please link this CP to Enpower with group link of Power Broker-Houston.   Please let me know when completed.  Thanks. P.S. I mentioned this to you, Melissa. But just a reminder that we need the  default broker fee on this to be $.03. Thank you! Chris Foster has requested that we set up a new broker - the Automated Power  Exchange, in EnPower. It is the same counterparty we already have in EnPower,  with the same name and contact information. Melissa, I believe you said we  could pretty easily add the name in the broker list if it was the same as in  the counterparty list, which Chris has verified it is. Please let me know if  you need anymore information. Thanks, Kate
