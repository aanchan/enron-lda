Tom and Mark are not spot traders, they're cash traders. This is what I was  referring to yesterday - that Real Time is now being charged $15 for trades -  but cash and term traders should still be charged the traditional $.005. Why  is Bloomberg recognizing these trades as Real Time? Kate   Hi Kate, per our discussion on yesterday about the $15.00 flat fee on Tom's  and Mark's deals, here is Bloomberg's response.  Please pass this info to all  of our traders.  Please let me know what the response is from them. Thanks Evelyn, as of April 16, 2001 our charge for Spot trades is a flat fee of $15/trade.
