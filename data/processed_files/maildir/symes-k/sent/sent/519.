Then it's in correctly - thanks. the deal is on peak thanks Looks like Tom forgot this deal on Friday - I've just entered it. Deal # is  514006. One thing I didn't check on was whether it was off-peak or on-peak.  Does this deal check out with APB? Let me know. Thanks, kate have you found out anything on this trade? thanks Kerri Thompson she says tom, i guess we can wait until monday..... I don't see any deals with any of these terms in Tom's trade log for today.  He's left the office, and I've left him a message on his cell phone - but  until then, I can't really say if this is good or not. Could it be a Mark  Fischer deal?
