I've changed the term to 12/4, and I'm going to make a note in our daily deal  correction report that this was due to a late report from EES. Thanks for  catching this. Kate Kate, below is the EES spreadsheet that has the shows the powerex trade shown  on 12/4/00.  Please verify and we can backdate the trade and reconfirm the  document, or we can initial Powerex change and send back to them to show that  we are in agreement.  Thanks Stephanie   CHECK CAREFULLY ONE COB TRANSACTION IS NORTH TO SOUTH AND ONE IS SOUTH TO  NORTH.
