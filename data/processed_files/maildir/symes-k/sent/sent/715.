I guess TFS originally had Palo on their confirm - which was wrong - then the  deal got changed to Mid-C. So Enpower is right, and Mike just let his broker  know to change the delivery point on the confirm. Thanks, Kate i was informed they are trying to schedule this deal.  so, as soon as you  find out can you pls let me know. thanks Kerri Thompson broker has palo verde 533220
