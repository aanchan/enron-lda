I'm not quite sure how this exchange began, but it sounds like Kroum is  referring to several different issues here. First of all, our forward  obligation report does not reflect cross-portfolio deals, an application  issue that Will Smith, and it looks like Kroum as well, has been working on  for the past few weeks.  Also, deal 498488 is a forward deal done on EOL between STSW and their own  desk. I haven't seen a trade WITHIN a desk before, but I'm sure anything is  possible. At any rate, this doesn't look like a cross-portfolio deal at all.  Am I missing something? As for the zeroed out deals, I'm pretty sure everyone here knows how to  properly kill deals in Enpower; however, it takes so long that sometimes we  simply zero out the volume in the interest of time. I've often wondered if  this litters the system and makes it more confusing for other people to do  their jobs - do you know anything about that? I just thought I'd ask these questions while the subject was being raised.  Please let me know if I can help facilitate these changes or improvements in  any way. Thanks, Kate              Cara,       I think the report should work that way even now. Southeast,      Region R7, please take a look at that when you test the report.                I saw lots of deals on the report with volume 0 and price 0, they were  entered that way        in Portland. There might be another reason, but I think someone wanted  to kill the deals.        There is an option in Deal Entry to do that, if one opens a deal and  right click with the        mouse on the status (Done), one can kill a deal.              Kroum                        Cara,      This is all I have so far. I would appreciate your help to make it  clearer.      If you find a deal No like that, I think it will make my job easier.      Thanks,      Kroum ENRON.com]  Forward Obs should show two sides of a Cross-Portfolio deal.  Find out what  needs to be done.  Contact Monica Lande or Kate Symes in Portland for more details
