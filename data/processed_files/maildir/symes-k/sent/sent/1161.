Thanks for checking on that, Rhonda - I'll make a mental note of it. Kate According to Rhonda we never use BP Amoco however, she thinks the Calgary  office does. Thanks I've changed this to BP Energy - and I was wondering - didn't BP Amoco change  over to BP Energy? Do we ever trade with the old counterparty name anymore? Kate   Cara Semperger deal 580011 CP name should be BP Energy not BP Amoco. Thanks
