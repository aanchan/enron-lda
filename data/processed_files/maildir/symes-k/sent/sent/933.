I left a note for Jeff last night, and apparently he already changed the  deals to reflect APB's price  554905 is $350 554912 is $325 Kate  apb is still sticking with this.  can you pls check with the trader. thanks I'm trying to get ahold of Jeff Richter on this, but without the brokers  around we probably can't get it done tonight. I would just say we have a  discrepancy with the broker at this point. Let me know if that's okay. Thanks, Kate 554905 broker has 350.00 554912 broker has 325.00 thanks!
