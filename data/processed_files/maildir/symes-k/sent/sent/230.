It's done! Thanks, Kate Please go ahead and change it. -Thanks! This should be changed to CAISO energy. Please let me know what you'd like me  to do - change the deal or wait. Thanks, Kate This deal is in "Pending - revised after sent to Ctrpty" status.  Some  changes have been made to the deal, but it still has an SP-15 delivery point  with Firm Energy.  Can you please find out whether it's the delivery pt. or  the energy type that is wrong? Thanks for your help! Kim
