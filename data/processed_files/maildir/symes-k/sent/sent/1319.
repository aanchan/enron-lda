I'm sorry about that, Kim. I just got word from Les on these and I'm changing  them as we speak. I'll e-mail you in just a minute when they're done. Thanks, Kate Have you gotten a reply from Les on these deals yet?  They are still  unconfirmed. Thanks! Kim Anytime! I try to at least PRETEND to the traders that we have civilized  correspondence. Little do they know...... Kate thanks for deleting that "smacking around" part chica! Les - Here's the latest list of unit contingent deals in need of unit names. I've  tried referring to your unit name list and entering them myself, but it looks  like some delivery points correspond to more than one unit. I.E. Navajo can  originate from LV Cogen OR Saguaro Power. If you could add these unit names  into the deals, or let me know what they are so I can enter them, it would be  much appreciated. Thanks, Kate Mornin' Sunshine!!! I need unit names for all of the following deals please: 593484 593486 594911 594915 595073 597061 597063 597065 598151 598153 Thanks! Kim
