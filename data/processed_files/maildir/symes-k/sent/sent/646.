Here you are, ladies. As per our prior discussion, these are the Dow Jones  index price reports I promised to send you. Let me know how this works for  you. If there are no questions, comments, or concerns, I'll forward the  e-mails to you each week on Tuesday afternoon as soon as I receive them. And thanks for encouraging Willie Harrell to automate the pub-posting system.  Sounds pretty logical to me!
