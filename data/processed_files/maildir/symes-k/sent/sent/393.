499013 was changed to a price of 180. Mike is having the broker pull their  tapes for today, but we won't get that information until tomorrow. In the  meantime, we're giving them the benefit of the doubt. I'll let you know if  anything else changes. Thanks, Kate 498837 not apb 499013  should be 180.00 thanks
