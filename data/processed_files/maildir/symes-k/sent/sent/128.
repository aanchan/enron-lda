I was alerted this morning to the urgency with which certain people in the  Portland office need this information; so I think it might help if they were  added to the e-mail list for name change/merger notifications. Following is  the list of Portland West Desk employees to add: Kate Symes Carla Hoffman Jeff Richter Chris Mallory Phillip Platter Jeremy Morris Thank you so much for your help. Kate Monica Lande Attached is the Preliminary Name Change/Merger notification report for Nov.  2000.  The final list with any additions will go out on Wed, Nov 22.   Name overlays will be done today, Mon, Nov. 20, right after notification is  given, and shortname changes will be done on Wed, Nov. 22.  Records on this report will be inactivated on Fri.,  Dec. 1.                  HAPPY THANKSGIVING! Cheryl x3-3103
