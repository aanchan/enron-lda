Okay, I don't know where Jeff's head was today, but he just checked with  Prebon and found he had done this deal without even knowing it! So he entered  it - Deal #461171. Thanks a lot for your patience, Stephanie. thanks One more Richter trade,. prebon shows:  11/16 Enron Buys Aquila Dec  2000 sp15 97.00 Thanks Prebon is sending a new confirmation with Constellation as the counterparty.  Broker mistake.  Hello I have a question, should the Counterparty on this trade be Peco Energy? We have Constellation but bro does not know trade as Constellation Tom Alonso's name is on bro confirm (Peco) but deal 459243.01 is under Mark  Fischer (COnstellation) Thanks
