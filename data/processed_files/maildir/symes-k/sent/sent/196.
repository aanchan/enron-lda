Oops, and one more thing. The price on this is entered both in Jeff's trade  log and in Deal Entry as $214.95. I verified that with Chris Mallory, who's  working on the California desk today. If Prebon still has a discrepancy, let  me know. Thanks, Kate JEff Richter Prebon sent over a statement where: Enron buys from EES 12/5-12/30 25 mw of SP-15 at $114.95
