Tracy just told me this counterparty (PPL Montana) is still pending credit.  Mike Swerzbin said he would prefer to wait this out, because he stands to  make money on the deal. So in the meantime, I've been told by credit that we  can't enter the deal in the system and calc it. I'm not sure how this works  in your case with the Prebon check-out, but basically it's a pending credit  reach an agreement. Does that help? Let me know. Thanks, Kate    Hi Kate, what's the status of this deal?    this deal is contingent on credit - he'll let me know later today whether or  not it's a good trade. thanks, Kate    sorry Friday, 3/9    what was the trade date on this? Prebon sent over a confirm for a deal where: Enron (Mike Swerzbin) buys from PPL Montana Cal'04-Cal'06 25 mw of Mid-C at  $45.00 off-peak hours. They did not tell me about this deal during checkout.
