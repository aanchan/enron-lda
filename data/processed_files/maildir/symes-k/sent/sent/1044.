Les - I received this list from the Confirms group this morning. Looks like they  need quite a few unit names for confirmation purposes. But if I remember  correctly, you didn't want these deals confirmed. Please let me know when you  get a chance, and I can go through and either change them to "no confirm" or  add the unit names.  Thanks, Kate Hi Kate,  The following are also unit contingent deals that we aren't able to confirm  unless we have a unit name. 562211 564613 566060 566062 566069 566071 566077 566078 Thanks! Kim Kimberly Hundl Hi Kate! Hope you had a good weekend! We need to know the unit name on these two unit contingent deals for Salt  River Project. Thanks! Kim
