It might be worth it to add Long Term California to Greg's trader ID profile  - if it's not too much trouble. He said it was unlikely he'd use it, but  there's always the potential. No rush, of course. And thanks again for your  help. Kate     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 Hello again Kate, Please see the desks below that Greg Wolfe is attached, and inform me if you would like me to link him to any other desks. Rgds. Samuel  713-853-9890 ENW _ GCP     	 	 	 Complete   Hi Kate, Your request is complete, effective upon refresh of the EnPower System, or  3/17/01. Let us know if Paul needs access to any other desks. Best Rgds. Samuel Thanks for doing that so quickly. I just spoke with Paul and he said it would  be best to include every long term desk under his name since he will  potentially do deals with all of the traders - Long Term Southwest Long Term Northwest Long Term California Long Term West Management Again, thank you, and please let me know if there's anything else I can do. Kate     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 	 Hello Kate, I've added Paul Choi to the EnPower System, however, in order for a Trader or  Mid-Marketer to have access to a Power Desk, he must be added to the specific desk by the  GCP Team. Please supply a specific list of desks in which Paul Choi needs access. Example Request(s):  Please add these Power Trader(s) to the following Desks: Paul Choi, Greg Wolfe Thanks, Samuel x3-9890 (GCP_Enron Networks) Thank you in advance for you help in adding this trader's name to the system: Add this Power Trader to the EnPower: Paul Choi Samuel Schott has told me that you would prefer to have the desk this trader  works for, but because Paul is a mid-marketer he works with several different  desks, including Long Term California and Long Term Southwest. Please let me  know if you need more information. Thanks, Kate Symes Trading Support 503-464-7486
