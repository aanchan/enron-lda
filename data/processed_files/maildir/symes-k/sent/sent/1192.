Here's the correspondence between Evelyn in the Houston Confirms group and  Paul Callahan at Bloomberg outlining the broker's new $15-per-trade fee.  Please let me know if you have questions or would like me to talk to someone  at Bloomberg about this. I'll also check with Tim to find out if the fee  change was ever negotiated with Enron. Thanks, Kate Kate for our deal 582589 and 582423 these deals according to Bloomberg the  fee should be $15.00.  Please pass on to Mark and Tom. Thanks! That is the commission for those trades. The rate that Bloomberg Powermatch now charges for cash trades is $15 per trade. At:  4/17 16:43  For the two deals traded on yesterday with Tom and Mark the fee is showing  as $15.00 flat on both confirmations.  Can you send revisions.  The numbers are 20010416410003 and 20010416410002  Thanks  cc:  That is not the case. I know what Mark and Tom trade, I apologize if I  misspoke. All daily trades, as well as hourly trades will now be a flat fee  charge of $15 per trade. This covers any size transaction.  At:  4/17 16:20     Tom and Mark are not spot traders, they're cash traders. The Real Time  guys   are now being charged $15 for trades - but cash and term traders should   still be charged the traditional $.005.                 cc:         Evelyn, as of April 16, 2001 our charge for Spot trades is a flat fee of   $15/trade.
