Sean has COB in his trade log. He originally had Mid-C, then crossed it out.  Sounds like Amerex just hasn't updated their website with the change.  Amerex West deal 576348 Sean Crandall Amerex confirmed deal as COB however, their web checkout has Mid-C.  Can you  please reconfirm the delivery point with Sean. Thanks
