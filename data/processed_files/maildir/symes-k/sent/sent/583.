Trades with TransAlta go through their energy marketing subsidiary, called  TransAlta Energy Marketing (US) Inc. These deals were in under the parent  company, TransAlta Energy Marketing Corp. I know this is petty, but it makes  people like Rhonda cranky. For some reason she feels it is an offense  punishable by reaming. I don't. This is just a  reminder. Kate red = correct counterparty name blue = incorrect counterparty name Rhonda L Denton also 519128 and 519230 Rhonda L Denton Okay, I'm going to be gentle and send my complaints to you and let you ream  the hourly people.  Please check the following deals.  They are all booked as  Transalta Energy and should be Transalta Energy Marketing (US) 513061 513114 516116 518007 518184 Thanks
