You're right - 458802 is a deal with Constellation, but it's part of a sleeve  Mike Swerzbin did for EES. Thanks for the spreadsheet, and for getting me on  the mailing list. Kate I spoke with Kim Hundle and deal # 458802 is not with EES I wasn't sure if I  had wrote the number down wrong or not.  Sorry.    I also spoke with Neil  Bresnan after we had spoke and he had said it should be no problem getting  you on the list.  I will check again and I apologize for the delay. Thanks Judy Jubran Whalan
