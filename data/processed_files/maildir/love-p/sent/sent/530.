Russ Severson FYI   Most of the deals are at NBPL/Peoples Russ Severson If these are new curves today, they will not show up in CPR until 6:30 am  tomorrow. This is the list of deals at the 2 locations. Phillip M Love Can you set up a mid for all deals at a location of NBPL/Peoples and  PGLC/NBPL.  The intramonth curve Chi./N/Border and the gas daily curve is  GDC-Chi./N/Bord.  Can you tell me how many deals are currently in the system  for these two locations.  Sorry to rush you, but I need these in for calcing  tonight.  Thanks. PL 3-7376
