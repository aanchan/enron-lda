Do you have an updated status on this issue?  Thanks. PL Russ Severson I have forwarded this message to Global Facilities, they set up locations,  after they set up the location, then we can map the curves. Russ Phillip M Love Can you please set this new location up, Nipsco/NGPL, with curves the same as  the original point, NGPL/Nipsco.  I believe they are as follows: gas daily  should be GDP-CHI. GATE, the intramonth should be NGI/CHI. GATE, and the Mid  should be NGI/CHI./NIPSCO. Please shout with any questions.  Thanks for your help. PL     	 	 	 Phillip, Please move the following two deals from their current location,  NGPL/Nipsco, to a new location Nipsco/NGPL.  We are setting up Nipsco as it's  own pipeline so as to better track positions. Please make the change  effective Feb. 1. Thanks, George
