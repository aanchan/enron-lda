Here is my groups book administrators.  If you need any further information,  please let me know.  Thanks. PL Jeffrey C Gossett Please fill out the Book admin section and the trading group section for your  appropriate books,  and send back to Chris and copy me by the date listed  below.  Thanks for your help.  Hopefully this will eliminate the official  book macro.  Thanks Chris Abel Attached is the updated spreadsheet, which provides the additional  information that you requested.  The Region Code for each book and your  previous evaluation of the book status' have been included.  I hope this will  help your group more easily identify which books are theirs.  As you are  aware, Sally considers this a high priority project.  I would appreciate it  if you could return this spreadsheet to me by Wednesday, the 14th.   Please refer to the previous memo about the rules for each field that needs  to be updated.  If you have any questions, please call me at x33102. Thanks for your help on this. Chris
