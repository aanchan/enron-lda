Way to go guys, keep it up. PL John Valdes We have received the April Liquidation file from portfolio accounting.  We  are now up to 89%(Tagg deals containing Sitara #'s) with only a small handful  containing Sitara #'s that are invalid(13).  Thanks for the work that you and  your groups have done to make it easier to match up deals on the back end of  the process.  Again, thank you. John
