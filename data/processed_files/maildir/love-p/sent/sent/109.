Dawn C Kenne I?don't know if you've heard, but starting Jan 1,2001 you  will  nolongerbeable  use a cell phone while driving unless you have a "hands  free"adapter.?  I went to Circuit City and they wanted $50 for a hands  freeadapter!!!? Ihave managed to get hold  of some "off brand" units and was  wonderingifanyone is interested. These kits  are compatible with any  mobilephone  andone size fits all. I paid $8 each for  buying in quantity.  I'msellingthemfor  $10. I tried them out on Erisson, Motorola, & Nokia phones  andtheyworked perfectly. A photo is attached. Take a look and let me  knowifyouwant one. ~Ray Pittman Attachment:  handsf~1.jpg ?  - HANDSF~1.JPG
