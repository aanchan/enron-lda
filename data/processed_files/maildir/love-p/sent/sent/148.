 Judith Eder; Lisa Cross; Deborah Carpenter; Cathy Garfield Kranz  This story was passed to me today & I thought you might find it    interesting:        Al Gore gave a big speech this week about how his faith is so   "important"     to him.  In this attempt to convince the American people that we   should    consider him for president, he announced that his favorite Bible verse   is    John 16:3.       Of course the speech writer meant John 3:16, but nobody in the Gore    camp was familiar enough with scripture to catch the error.  And do  you    know what John 16:3 says?       John 16:3 says "And they will do this because they have not known the    Father nor    Me"    The Holy Spirit works in strange ways.    Pass it on..........
