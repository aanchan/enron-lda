Can you take a look at this and let me know what we officialized instead of  these. PL Phillip, Each month we (in accounting) pull the forward detail for the post ids which  were officialized at month end.  For February 2001, these post ids are on the  Report page in the FT Intra Ontario file but they are not officialized in  RunM: 1054684 1054685 1054686 1054689 Were there other post ids which were officialized for these particular  rolls?  If not, would you please officialize these so I can pull them. Best regards, Rachel
