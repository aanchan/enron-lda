FYI - new EOL reports rules.(see below) PL Jeffrey C Gossett Please make sure to follow this.  I will try to get access to at least one  person per desk during these hours.  I'll let you know.     	 	 	                            	 Due to the significant amount of activity on EnronOnline, and the large  number of users logged into the system during peak trading hours, please  inform your respective teams that they should not use the EnronOnline  applications (Reports, Product Manger, Profile Manager, and Data Manager)  between the hours of 7:30am and 10:00am.  Only those actions that are  absolutely critical should be performed (i.e. credit headroom adjustments,  etc.).   The IT group is reviewing the database in an attempt to make our queries more  efficient, but until further notice, these guidelines should be followed. Please call me if you have any questions. Thanks- Sheri
