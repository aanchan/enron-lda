FYI - keep an eye out for these. PL Dawn C Kenne Tagg is currently working on a situation where the bridge is creating  duplicate deals.  This started yesterday and we contacted the appropriate  books to kill the duplicate deal.  Yesterday, there were a total of eight  deals duplicating, so far today there are six.  They have narrowed down the  problem and Mike Swaim and Oscar Rivera think it should be resolved this  afternoon.   Meanwhile, Oscar is running a query that will let us know the duplicate  deals.  He will run this throughout the day and I will e-mail you the deals.   Listed below in Bold is the duplicate deals from today (two are from late  last night).  I have placed the risk book next to the deals.  Please forward  this to the appropriate people in your group.  I was not sure who runs the  Singapore book, if London could let me know I would appreciate it. I will keep you updated on the progress.  Sorry for any inconvenience this  may be causing.  Feel free to call me if you would like more information. Thanks, Dawn 3-9353 Dawn,  This is the list of duplicate deals. The last 6 on the list are new. TAGGDeal EOL Deal CREATED_DTM
