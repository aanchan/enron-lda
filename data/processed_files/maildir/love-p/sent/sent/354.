Phillip M Love It was great to hear from you.  Things are going well for me at Enron. I am  on the trading floor working with the natural gas traders.  The work is fast  paced and very educational.   How is your family doing?  I hope it is still expanding with recent grand  children. I was sorry to hear of your leaving NSF.  They are definitely going to miss  your expertise and committment.  I am sure however, that you are exciting  about the "time off".   Please stay in touch and if you are ever passing through Houston, please look  me up.  I look forward to talking with you soon. PL
