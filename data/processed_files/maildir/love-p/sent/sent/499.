Catherine'; 'Hall, Joe'  Everyday, thousands of children are abandoned by their biological fathers.  These men leave the mothers without benefit of support. An ongoing effort  is being made to locate these "deadbeat dads" and hold them accountable to  these children.  Attached is a photo of a child who desperately needs to locate one of  these deadbeats. Your help is greatly appreciated.   <<Jessica (1).jpg  - Jessica (1).jpg
