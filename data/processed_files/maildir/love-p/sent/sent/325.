Jim Little Attached is the liquidation support for July.  I am still in the process of  tying these deals to the General Ledger and currently the difference is  sitting in the Texas Region as the problem is most likely related to the  financial deals on Co. 12.  Please do your research as usual and I will give  you a detailed list of any changes if it relates to your region.
