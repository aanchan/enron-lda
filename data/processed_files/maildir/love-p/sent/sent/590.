FYI Jeffrey C Gossett Dawn C Kenne In order for EOL to support the Broker Client Application, we are requesting  that EOL be removed from the broker field in Tagg on all previous EOL  transactions.  We would like this "sweep" to be performed on Thursday  evening, if possible.  What this means to end users is that they will no  longer be able to query on the broker field to find EOL deals in Tagg.  The  only way to search for EOL deals in the future will be to query on the EOL  transaction number. Please communicate this new procedure to your groups.  Also, I don't know if  Ron/Joe cover the Canada confirmations, if not, please let me know who the  confirmations contact is in Canada.  Jeremy/Ron, please let me know if Thursday evening works for you to clean out  the broker field. Thank
