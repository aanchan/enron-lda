Jim, would you mind setting up a meeting with the appropriate people so that  we can get this resolved, I was assured by Misti Day the first week of  December that this would be fixed.  Thanks for your help. PL     	 	 	 No Phillip M Love did this ever get resolved? PL     	 	 	     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 There were two negative originations in the central gas daily book.  One in  August for $489,600 and one in Sept for $258,000.  The GDCentral book got the  credit/income for these through our top level origination entries.   Thanks, Todd     	 	 	 Misty and/or Todd Are you aware that the Central desk is expecting negative originations for  July through September to cover demand reimbursement on Natural Gas Pipeline  for July through September? Thanks, Cathy     	 	 	 Originations are not booked to the GL.  They are entered in the CS module of  SAP by the portfolio group.  Jim L. then incorporates them in his OA's.   Misti Day or Todd Warwick would be the one to contact.     	 	 	 Jim It is my understanding that the Central desk is expecting negative  originations to cover demand reimbursements for Natural Gas Pipeline for July  through September 2000.  The amount is approximately $300,000 per month.  Are  you aware of this and is there anything I can do to help clear this variance? Thanks, Cathy
