FYI, it may be wise to run a few of your macros from Jeff's machine.  I would  just see if it runs and close without saving. PL Jeffrey C Gossett My PC has been moved to windows 2000.  Please have everyone come test  applications on my PC this week to make sure they work in this environment.   All PC's will be moved next week unless they have been notified of specific  problems. Thanks
