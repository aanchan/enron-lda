FYI - those of you running firm books.  These adjustments described below are  need to put these in the appropriate schedules - C & E.  Schedule C should be  used for MTM adjustments and Schedule E should be used for all other  adjustments.  Shout with any questions. PL Jeffrey C Gossett Please clarify.  Thanks. Jeff, I need your help with a few items.  In the DPR rolls for several books this  month there were topside adjustments inserted.  It was my understanding that  all topsides would be included on the associated roll schedules (Sch E and  Sch C).  Investigating all of these is greatly increasing our reconciliation  time.  Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.  Here are a few  books that had topsides: MTM Topsides that should have been on Schedule C GD-Central FT-Texas FT-Central Liquidation topsides that should have been on Schedule E GD-Central FT-Northwest FT-Ontario Let me know if you need more information or if there is anything we can do to  help.  Thanks.      Greg x35399
