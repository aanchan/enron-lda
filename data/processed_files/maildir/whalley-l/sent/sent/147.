Joe Mr. Sutton, I'm emailing you on Greg Whalley's behalf.  Is it possible for Greg to join  you on the company plane on Sunday over to London for the Open House?    I  understand you have different plans on the return.   I can book him  commercial on the return.  No worries, if the answer is no, I'm holding  commercial flights both ways.    Sunday, February 27 Please advise. Liz Taylor Assistant to Greg Whalley
