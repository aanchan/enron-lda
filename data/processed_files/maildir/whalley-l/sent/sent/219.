Christie, Are you needing to do this during the month of April?  Throw me back some  dates to play with.  The 3rd &4th week of April are no good.  Early May could  work out fine, it that's not too late.   Liz Hey Greg! Though you're unavailable on March 21st to speak at Stanford, Stanford still  wants YOU!!! Will you please check your calendar and  propose some dates you can make it  there--the class is about 50 Exec eds, CXO levels form high profile  companies.  It would be an easy presentation--about 1hr 1/2 on "The evolution  of Enron". Thanks! --Christie. 	Please respond to "Haim Mendelson" 		  Christie, If Greg comes to the Bay Area sporadically, we can plan around that.  What I have in mind now is our E-Commerce Seminar (Wednesdays every two weeks) which is an open forum for discussing E-Commerce issues.
