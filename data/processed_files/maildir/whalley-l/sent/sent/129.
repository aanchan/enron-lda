Yes, we watch the game from the rooftop.  You can also with your pass go into  the stadium. Liz Does this mean tickets to the game as well, or can we see the game from  there?  Sign me up for two tickets tentatively. Thanks Jay Greg Whalley has rented out the Rooftop Deck & Clubhouse at Union Station for  Opening Game on Friday, April 7.  You are cordially invited to party with  vs. PHI.  Please contact me about the numbers of tickets you will need.  We may be able  to accommodate some members of your team.    The rooftop can hold up to 75  people.   Many Thanks, Liz Taylor x31935
