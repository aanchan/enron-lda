cc:	  I had to leave early yesterday, but I was able to get in touch with John to follow-up with your page.  See response below and feel free to provide a specific example for us to research.  Thanks Keoni Almeida California Independent System Operator phone: 916/608-7053 pager:  916/814-7352  Cc:	Almeida, Keoni; Kondragunta, Vijayakumar  UE is UD less any Unavailable Capacity due to No Pay Condition.  Thus, UE  is always less than or equal to UD.  Unavailable Capacity only applies to  generators.  As a result, the UD and UE may show a difference for  generators, but not for the loads or interties.  Uninstructed Energy charge is calculated by Region.  The sum of the UEs in  a region should equal to the billable quantity in CT 407.  If Caroline  provides the specific trade date for her example, we can check further.  C.P.  Cc:	Almeida, Keoni  CP/VJ-  Enron is struggling with the UD and UE columns in their  instructed/uninstructed energy detail file.  The specifics of their  questions are below.  Could you please review and respond to their  questions below.

The volumetric totals in one of these two columns is supposed to match the  volume in the Settlement Detail file for Charge Type 407.  However, I have  discovered a couple of (annoying) things in September:  In comparing the two columns within the table -  For LocationTypes L and C, there is no volumetric difference between the  two columns.  For LocationType G, there is a volumetric difference of 153.15 (more in  the Deviation column than in the Energy column)  In comparing IE to the Settlement Statement data -  When I use the volumes in the Uninstructed Energy column for all  LocationTypes, I have a volumetric difference of 10.52 (less in the IE  data).  However, when I use the Uninst Energy column for L and C, and the  Deviation column for G, I then have a volumetric difference of 142.63  (less in the Settlement Statement Detail data).  My question is two- or several-fold:  What causes the volumes in the two columns to be different for the G type?  I could find no discernable value to make it change anywhere in the data.  Which column has the values that the ISO uses in determining the total net  Why don't the two sets of volumes match (IE to Settlement)?  I really need to understand this, as we are required to tie all of our  customer's volumes back to the Settlement Statement file, and, again, when  the backup file doesn't match or is inconsistent, that makes our goals  that much harder to achieve.
