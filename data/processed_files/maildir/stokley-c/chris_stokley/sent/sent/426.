Janet, 	Good to hear from you, what is it that they have you working on there days? Also, what meeting did you get pulled into that would have my name mentioned? 							Chris Chris - I was in a meeting today and your name came up - in a good way - and I thought I would send a short message to say HELLO.  I heard you are "commuting" to Houston to work every week.  WOW - your commute is worse than mine!!  I was glad to hear that you are still at Enron. Janet Peake
