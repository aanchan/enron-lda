Is there anyway you can push this back to the following week when Murray will be in town. Please let me know if there is anything I can help with. Thanks,  Poston Neal, we have room 42C1 reserved from 9am - 12:00noon. Thanks,  David Poston Great.  Let me know the room, and I'll send out a meeting update.  Or you can email everyone; whatever works best. Neal cc:	  Thanks Neal.  I'm working with Dan Luciano to get a room & equipment for Tuesday morning. Where:	 Dave Poston will be doing the demo here in Houston. The main demo should take maybe an hour and a half depending on how many questions we ask.  After that, Dave would like to go over things in more detail if anyone wants to learn more.  He says he can spend 4 hours or more discussing it if we want. I'll send out location information when I get it.
