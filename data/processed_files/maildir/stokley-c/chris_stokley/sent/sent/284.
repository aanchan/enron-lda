Don,  	In the future send your e-mail to the person you spoke w/ in the first place before trying other routes. I did send you an e-mail yesterday, if you do not get it by close of business today then let me know. 							Chris Stokley 							 Brett,  In talking to Chris Stokley yesterday, he said to draw the amount for the above subject invoice from your collateral account.  He was going to Email me a memo stating this.   To date, I have not received that Email.  Since you Emailed me the information for last billing cycle, can you furnish me this info for the above invoice?   Would like it in writing before we apply the credit. Thanks,  Don
