I was told that all three UDC's have completed these reviews. Below is a list of contact information for you to request a copy of the report(s).  It is my understanding that the UDC's are not sending out copies unless they receive a request.  So, please contact the people listed below in order to obtain a copy of the MDMA/MSP reports to review and submit with your audit reports due to the ISO on September 28, 2001.
