Val,               Don't know if you heard yet, but  Greg's last day w/ Enron was yesterday     Gawd Boy - you have more questions for me...does this mean you do not require my assistance with CA Block Forwards?  Since you NEVER returned my phone calls??  What's the poop scoop on Jeff S? Dennis left the NW about a year ago and went to Louisiana I think. Somewhere down around your parts.  Hey, is that Steve guy - can't remember his last name - still working in Fundies?  He worked with Jim B. in Structuring before they got uppity and went to Broadband. Then Steve came back and Jim went to Houston - THAT Steve.  What's his last name and is he still there? Importance: High    Val,          Do you know where Dennis resides these days, I recommended him  to someone but he is no longer with Portland Mortgage.
