Mark, 	I  left a message on both your cell and work number along with paging you. The only reason I am stating this is so you know that I did try to envolve you in this discussion last week.  1:00  is fine for me and I look forward  to meeting you. Where would you like to meet? Cc:	O'Neil, Murray P. Chris, 	I will be available at 1.00pm tomorrow, however, you should make an arrangement quickly as my time is booked up by Christina Liscana and I sometimes have little control over this part of my life. Concerning the e-mail message attached, the actions items referred to regarding the deal ticket are completely news to me as neither I or any of my group was involved in this discussion which obviously affects us. Perhaps you will be able to shed some light on this. Regards, mark Mark, 	I would like to meet w/ you some time this week about the information  being captured on the Deal Ticket. I am open on Wed. or Thurs of. this week. Please let me know what time and day is convient for you. 							 								Chris 							     503-807-8959 		 Cc:	Albrecht, Kristin FYI? I left Mark a message today indicating that I was not comfortable that they were capturing all of the different parameters associated with Baseline and Bandwidth on our current contracts correctly.  My biggest concern here is that we need to make sure that CSC who is doing our billing is reflecting the same information.  There needs to be an action items which I thought was started two weeks ago to ensure that everything which is needed by CSC on the Deal Ticket is captured by us on our deal tickets so we can on populate a deal ticket once.  The ultimate would be that we have more on our deal ticket then CSC needs and they can pull just their relative elements. MO Cc:	Matheson, A K; O'Neil, Murray P.; Stubbs, Shelly Brenda, 	Operations have for some time communicated the consumption excess and deficiency charges to CSC on the deal request form in the comments section. They have also indicated the method of calculation. We strongly suspect that these are not being charged correctly and as a result Barry VanDerHoarst and I am currently running an investigation of 10 randomly selected deals to check the CSC pricing calculations. Please let me know who in your group should be involved with this initiative. We have been capturing this information on our deal tracker now for the past two weeks for both power and gas. Regards, Mark AK, Thanks for the voicemail yesterday.  This is what I need confirmation on: Power - Are the consumption bands being captured on the del sheets?  Are they being communicated to CSC for invoicing purposes?  If they are being captured and communicated, what day did this start?  It had to be within the last week.  If they are not being captured and communicated to CSC, it needs to start ASAP and I would like confirmation of the official start day. Gas - It is my understanding that they are being captured on the deal sheets and in the Risk books.  I have confirmed that CSC is billing over/ undertakes.  I just want to make sure that the deal sheets, when consolidated with the customer/new deal set-up with CSC, continues to capture that information. Thanks for your help. Brenda: Following up w/ my voicemail to you, attached is the information I received from Deal Management which I confirmed w/ Risk Management. Hope this is helpful. A.K. Matheson     		 cc:	  This is what I know. The DASH definitely captures the consumption band.  As I understand it, a consumption risk book is not up and running.  I believe Mallik's intention is to have in running by the end of the year. If you need anything else come see me.
