FYI cc:	  We are looking at adding this but as it is confidential information, we have to obtain permission.  Turnaround time on the clickathome mailbox is within a few hours but no more than 24 hours.  Thanks.       		 cc:	  Does "People Finder" currently exist as an option in this web sit? If not, could we get that added as an option in the very near future. 	ps. What kind of turnaround time should I expect on a response from the support group when I send an issue in? <Embedded StdOleLink
