I never got his message, why would he not follow up with an e-mail on something this important? I will take a look at this issue and get it resolved. In the future please have them send an e-mail on any time sensitive issues. Please make sure and forward this e-mail on to all the people that were copied in his e-mail. 				 			Chris Chris, if you want I, can handle this with George directly.  Let me know. Keoni Almeida California Independent System Operator phone: 916/608-7053 pager:  916/814-7352  Cc:	Perez, Glen; Plumley, Jeanette; Jaschke, Allen  Keoni,  Looking at Enron's data for trade days it seems that data from trade day  March 17 has gone up from 175-200 Mwh. per hour to 1700 Mwh. per hour. I  left a message with Chris Stokley while we were down in Alhambra on  Wednesday but have not heard from him.  I have enclosed a graphic of several months, for comparison, as well as  data for that same period. Please take a look at data from 3/17/01 on. If  they need to make a change I would suggest making a change for 3/18 first  then doing changes for 3/17 and days afterwards.  Let me know if you have any questions.   <<Enron 3-17-01.doc  <<Enron data.xls  Thanks,  David Alvarez  Data Quality  (916) 608-5915  - Enron 3-17-01.doc << File: Enron 3-17-01.doc    - Enron data.xls << File: Enron data.xls
