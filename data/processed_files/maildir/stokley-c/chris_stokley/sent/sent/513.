I was correct Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  I was on vacation last week and you know how that is trying to get ready to go and then getting swamped upon return.  I regret to tell you that I am not going to accept the position and I am going to stay put until the beginning of next year.  I have family and personal reasons why I do not want to accept the position.  I hope that this does not discount me from future positions that may become available and I hope you will keep me in mind.  I appreciate you & Murray considering me, because I respect your work and opinions.  Please keep in touch with me.  Thanks! Importance:	High Kelley, 	I am guessing that you do not have good news for us, since I have not heard back from you.
