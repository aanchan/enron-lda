Jeff, 	Here is a first cut of some of the questions that  need to be answered by the generator that is offering this service. I will have more as I dig into the detail this    	week. 			1) Non performance by counterparty (don't deliver energy when called) :                                                        - Who is going to be held financially responsible if the generator is unable to meet the ISO instructions to Inc or Dec gen?  			2)  Is the generator located in the grid or out of the grid? 			        - This is important to know so that we can evaluate our control area risk.                                                 3)   Has the generator registered and been certified by the ISO to deliver all of the A/s Products(Regulation,Spin, Non-Spin and Replacement) 			        - Need to know the specific unit ID's of the performing units so that we can verify w/ the ISO. 			    			        Monday. 		 		Chris
