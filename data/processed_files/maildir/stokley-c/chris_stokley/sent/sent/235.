    		 cc:	  cc:	      		 Attached is a zip file with a compressed excel file showing our  computation of the September settlement.  Please review the spreadsheet and  contact me to discuss the deviations in our computations.  I had to send  you a numerical file due to the large size of the active computational file and  all the embedded links to the exposte data files, etc.  If you have  questions, call me at 206-615-0961.  I look forward to a speedy resolution  of our outstanding settlement issues.  - September.zip
