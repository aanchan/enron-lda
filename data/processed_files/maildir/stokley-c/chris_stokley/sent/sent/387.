    AK, Thanks for the voicemail yesterday.  This is what I need confirmation on: Power - Are the consumption bands being captured on the del sheets?  Are they being communicated to CSC for invoicing purposes?  If they are being captured and communicated, what day did this start?  It had to be within the last week.  If they are not being captured and communicated to CSC, it needs to start ASAP and I would like confirmation of the official start day. Gas - It is my understanding that they are being captured on the deal sheets and in the Risk books.  I have confirmed that CSC is billing over/ undertakes.  I just want to make sure that the deal sheets, when consolidated with the customer/new deal set-up with CSC, continues to capture that information. Thanks for your help. Brenda: Following up w/ my voicemail to you, attached is the information I received from Deal Management which I confirmed w/ Risk Management. Hope this is helpful. A.K. Matheson     		 cc:	  This is what I know. The DASH definitely captures the consumption band.  As I understand it, a consumption risk book is not up and running.  I believe Mallik's intention is to have in running by the end of the year. If you need anything else come see me.   Mariano   A K Matheson cc:	  Mariano: In your review of the following contracts, is the DASH capturing the consumption band and is this structured into the risk books? Pac Bell Home Depot	 Sysco EOP Pepsi  "Medge Industries" Please advise. Thanks. A.K.
