This seems like a really good time to ask for that ranking J this is good.... I doubled checked this with Stacey but I wanted to let you know that it is not Enron Works Operations dep't policy to provide cell phones to all employees unless they are in some type of supervisory or managerial and above position. These cell phones are strictly for business use and for emergencies related to work. This policy also applies to all the East risk group as well.  It seems to me that some things are done differently here when compared to the Houston office and if you feel that it is a necessity for you to have a company cell phone by all means talk to Tim about getting a cell phone under his department. Obviously, if you do use a cell phone for business purposes then the applicable charges can be expensed.  Sorry guys, I don't make the rules, I only tell you about them. John
