Stokley, Give me a shout when you get in and I now use MSN messenger.  Had to delete the yahoo. Chad, 	I will be in Houston next week, make some room on your busy schedule. I will give you an update on what is going on when I get there. Also, are you using a new IM system, I never see you on the Yahoo system 						me
