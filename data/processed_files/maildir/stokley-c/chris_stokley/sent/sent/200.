Jeanette Plumley Data Quality Auditor California ISO 916-608-5971 		Three weeks! How did you pull that one off 		               Chris 		     Thanks Chris, I am really hoping to have all of the audit plan 		     correspondence completed by Wednesday because I am taking three weeks 		     off of 		     work.  So, I would really appreciate it if you could get the audit 		     plan to 		     me as soon as possible.  Thanks for getting back to me and let me know 		     if 		     you have any other questions or hold up.  Thanks again.

We had 		               a mix up w/ AA that had to get worked out but I think we are 		     clear to go 		               forward. I have the Audit Plan from AA so I will give them 		     my comments 		               and send it to you by tomorrow. 		               Chris
