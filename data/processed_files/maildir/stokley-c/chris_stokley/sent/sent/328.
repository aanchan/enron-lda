Yes, but sadly know one took the initiative to follow through on this item. I had to call today and get the ball rolling because it was never moved to emergency status.  								Chris Cc:	Rutledge, John Did Bob follow thur with this for you? Bob, 	I am a little confused, my understanding was that you would be able to escalate these items to get a quick turnaround time in comparison to going the normal process. What you are recommending sounds like the normal process, am I incorrect on that conclusion?  When can I expect to get feedback from CSC with the process listed below?  								Chris John/Chris - I spoke to Steve Walker with Team Enron this morning about your request.  He'll be contacting you to help fill out the request form and get it submitted.  When the request is completed, it should be forwarded to Jacqueline Jackson in my group for submission to CSC.  With respect to your time for completion requirements, we'll need to work with CSC on prioritization if there are any issues. Bob     ??Z5??J/?3OI?yr??<M8.?__:/?s?:??
