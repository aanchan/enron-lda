In accordance with FERC ?s April 6, 2001 Order Dismissing Rehearing, Accepting Compliance Filing and Directing the Recalculation of Lower Wholesale Rates, CalPX has implemented the $150 breakpoint detailed in FERC?s December 15, 2000 order.  CalPX has included an adjustment amount on the January 2001 Day-Ahead and Day-of invoices reflecting the breakpoint implementation.  In summary, CalPX calculated the Day-of and Day-Ahead market settlements and Block Forward settlements as usual, and included an adjustment amount that took into account congestion, bid prices, overscheduling, and block forward contracts.  These adjustments are detailed in new forward market products created specifically for the adjustments (see new product list below).  The attached file provides a further explanation of the method used. Also attached are the CalPX filing requesting guidance and FERC's response. The January Forward market invoice, price cap adjustments, and CTS invoices are scheduled to be released May 8, 2001.
