Maurice,               Thursday at  3:00pm would be fine for all of us involved in the meeting.                                                                   Chris   Cc:  Gentlemen, I have been pulled into an emergency task force this morning by Evan Hughes to address some CA issues for which you are probably aware.  Therefore, I must reschedule our meeting for tomorrow afternoon or Friday.  I would like to try 3:00pm on Thurs.  What are your schedules looking like?
