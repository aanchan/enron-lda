I think I am only getting billed through Sept., but I will check. As far as the car goes, I am fine w/ just using a cab and I will continue staying at an apartment in Mid-Town(Under someone else's name). 					Thanks Tell me about the HomeCorp room(s).  I just got a bill for Oct. under Steve Swain's name, but HomeCorp said that there is no longer an apartment in your name.  Did you just move into the other apartment, or do I need to start booking you a hotel room?  Also, do you need a car at this point, or is a cab still working ok? Kathy Every week through Nov. for rt. now. Also, would you mind getting me up to date on the travel expenses you know of ( plane tickets, travel miles, apt. etc.) thanks! 							Chris Chris, You have no travel arranged after this week.  If you'll send me your travel dates I'll get something on the books for you. Kathy
