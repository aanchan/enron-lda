Andy, 	That is 30 out of a total of 100 if I understood you correctly. Are the other 70 just the straight commodity deals? Thanks for your help on this item. 						Chris Chris-- The file attached below lists all the Project Phoenix deals.  I believe that all GNO deals (approximately 30 of them) are covered. Let me know if you have any other questions. Thanks, Andy Attached find the Project Phoenix Status Report for 24 August. Please call me if you have any questions/comments.  << File: Phoenix 082401.xls   Stephanie Segura West Power, EES Transition Tel: 713.853.7430
