Kourtney, 	Could you take a look at the e-mail below and see you can gather this information for the 2nd qtr.  Chris.  Please forward the California ISO numbers for the 2nd quarter 2001 in the same format as you have prepared in the past (see below.)  We will need this information by Wed, 7/18/01.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks, Melissa   <Embedded Picture (Metafile)
