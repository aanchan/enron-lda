Thanks for your help Mark. Did you also get a chance to find the presentation document that you were going to be using in your meeting today?

It's hard to read it when it's printed from the current color slide.  << File: PrintableDealRoutingProcess.ppt   <Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)
