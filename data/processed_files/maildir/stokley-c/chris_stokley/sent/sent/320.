FYI  The first test file for the MV90 Interval Data Extract project has beenposted to the common/shared directory. It is all the data for Sunday, 8/5. If/when this test file is accepted, we will be able to begin daily production at any time. Also, the Project Proposal for this effort was reviewed and approved this morning and will be priced and forwarded to Enron before the end of the day today or first thing tomorrow morning. * Steve I need a timeline of the request, and what has been going on for the past couple of weeks related to this.  When was the request made?  When did CSC receive it?  What have they done with it?  I know this was discussed several business days back. I don't have a problem with the approval for the emergency request AFTER someone explains why we have had a delay.      Cc:	Hughes, Evan; Herod, Brenda F.; Hart, Vivian; Winter, 	Maurice; Ha, Kenny; Rutledge, John; Symms, Neal Steve and Bob, please work with me Monday morning as soon as possible to do whatever we need to do to escalate the status of this request to the highest response level possible.  Help me get the approval and forms needed to initiate work on this project on Monday. If we need to meet with the requesters, please advise. Thanks, Richard Vivian Hart I am trying to help some people in our team to obtain a data download from MV90 of all interval usages on a daily basis.  This has been a big issue with our traders in the California market.  They have been trying to get this information to get better Schedule numbers for power usages. John Rutledge from IT had filled a work request for CSC to start this work, but according to CSC, for this to be approved as an emergency request you have to approve it.  This is a high priority request for the traders.  CSC can start on this Monday first thing and start giving us samples. Please approve this request as an emergency request. Attached is the work request and I've asked Richard Miller to help escalate this also. Thanks. Jacqueline M Jackson Chris I went ahead an submitted this request to CSC.  I called and asked that they treat it as high priority so that the work can began immediately. Jacqueline M Jackson           cc: Please see the attached request for your action.  Thank You. Enron Energy Services Jackie- I am forwarding a completed WIP to you as instructed by Steve Walker. Kind regards, * John <<WR MV90 data.doc           cc:	"Chris Stokley" John- I have attached a copy of the Work Request for this effort. Please review it to be sure that it accurately reflects your need. Everywhere on the form where you find 3 questions marks (???), you need to supply the data. If there is no information to be filled in, feel free to leave the field blank. The only fields that are REQUIRED are the fields for Lead requestor (the person who can answer questions related to this request), the Alternate requestor (someone who can answer questions in the lead's absence) and the Business sponsor (the person who can authorize spending for this effort if it approved-must be VP level or above) When you have filled in those fields, please forward this form to Jackie Dublin. (They are aware of this request, but need the official request from Enron.) Please let me know if you have any questions. * Steve 	Miller" Chris- To clarify what I meant regarding prioritization: CSC handles multiple, often independent, requests from ENA as well as EES, many of which are of the "we need this as soon as possible" variety. What they want from us (not just EES, but Enron as a whole) is a prioritization of *all* of these outstanding requests, not just what our group might have asked of them. Sorry about the confusion, * John Rutledge/HOU/EES on 07/26/2001 (Embedded     Enron Energy Services image moved 	Michael Steve- Here's a quick synopsis of what we need: Users want actual historical metered data. If they can't get the data before it has been EEV'd (?) by MV-90, they need to know, for each value, whether it is the actual metered amount or an estimated value. Users understand that there may be missing data, but do not require the meta-data detailing this. However, this is with the understanding that the back-fill data will eventually arrive at some later date. We want any account- and meter-descriptive data as well as the associated volumetric data. A  test file to see what kind of data are available and a few consecutive days worth of data to get a feel for volumes are needed. If data is received from 12 - 6 a.m., how soon after 6 a.m. can we get a file? Please do not "burn in" this process just yet because data and timing requirements may change. Chris- With the bullets above, Steve has promised to turn around the completed WIP by COB today or tomorrow morning. Hopefully this will at least get the ball rolling. It is then up to the business to determine whether to proceed and how to prioritze it. There must be concerted effort from the business to prioritize requests to CSC. Steve gave me Richard Miller's name as the EES coordinator for these requests. Please contact him and let me know what you find out. Going forward we MUST establish who is responsible for filling these things out and keeping track of them. I've heard different things from different people, and I don't want to end up (nor should anyone else) being the person who fields random and anonymous lobs from the other side of the fence.
