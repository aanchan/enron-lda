I will swing by on Monday and pick up a copy. Thanks for your help. 			Chris Cc:	O'Neil, Murray P.; Brakke, Rebecca I have these in a notebook.  I will work on getting soft copies.  Would you like me to get copies made in the meantime. Also, I believe all of this info has been provided to the Project Phoenix group and should be on file in their file room. Becky - let's discuss this 1st thing Monday. ben Ben, 	Could you please send me by e-mail, the Deal Overview Book.
