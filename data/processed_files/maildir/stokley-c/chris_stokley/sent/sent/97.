Keoni, 	What is the total $ amount of the payments due to the SC's for this charge type? Cc:	Sheidun, Donna I confirmed that since Enron does not deviate from their schedules in real time a good portion of the payments have been going to Enron.  It is still up in the air what they will do with these charges.

Just thought I'd let you know.  I'll  keep after him first thing in the morning.
