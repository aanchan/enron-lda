Keoni Almeida California Independent System Operator phone: 916/608-7053 pager:  916/814-7352  Cc:	Gerber, Spence; Shafa, Masoud; ISO Client Relations  The Unscheduled Demand Penalty was ordered by FERC in its December 15,  2000 order to be effective on January 1, 2001 Trade Date. The ISO is  filing a request with FERC to suspend this penalty. Additionally SCE and  PG&E have jointly filed at FERC requesting suspension of the penalty.  Until FERC provides direction and clarification, ISO will calculate the  Unscheduled Demand Penalty charges and credits, but will not include them  in the settlement statements.  There is no impact to any other charges or  payments since the penalty and the allocation of the proceeds is self  contained.  Attached is a description of the Unscheduled Demand Penalty.   <<Unscheduled Demand Penalty.doc  CRCommunications  Client Relations Communications  - Unscheduled Demand Penalty.doc
