I am fine with the timeline as long as we meet the September deadline.  				Chris Hi Chris, I left you a message regarding the timing of our work for the ISO Report. Again, please call me when you get a chance to discuss so that we can get that finalized for your plan.  As Linda had mentioned, we plan on starting the work in July as the due date is in September.  Please let me know if this is not sufficient time. Thanks. 713 345-6958 Chris, We plan on performing our work in July in order to be able to issue the report in August. Please let me know if you disagree with this timeframe. Thanks, Linda Linda,      I am ok with the  most of the Audit plan except for the date of completion. August 2001 seems quite excessive since we now have one SQMD audit under our belts. Please provide to me the logic behind the thought that this Audit will take over 3mths to complete.                                          Thanks                                           Chris      Chris,      I just wanted to follow up with you to ensure that you received the      ISO Audit      Plan draft yesterday.  If you did not receive it, please let me know      so that I      can re-send it.  We would like to receive your feedback before we      finalize the      document.      Thanks,      Linda      *******************Internet Email Confidentiality      Footer*******************      Privileged/Confidential Information may be contained in this message.
