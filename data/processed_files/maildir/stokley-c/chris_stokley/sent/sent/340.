Cc:	Stokley, Chris Importance:	High Can you run this down for Chris, and copy me on it.  If they haven't completed it, I'd like to why and when it will be done. Chris,  I apologize for this sitting here since Wednesday with no response.  I was in CSC's offices on Wednesday and Thursday.  I need to get a lap top to check in when I travel. Importance:	High Brenda, 	I need to give Jeff Ricter an update on where this item stands with CSC. I am still going off of the e-mail listed below stating that CSC could meet this deliverable by sometime this week. This is the item that we talked about in last week's Project Ranger meeting, and agreed needed to put on the high priority list. If you have any questions on this item, please feel free to call me at 503-807-8959. Thank for your help on this item. 								Chris  Chris, In our meeting with Pat Priestley yesterday, she said it would not be difficult to post a CSV file to an FTP server for all the Interval Meter Data accounts in MV90.  Pat said that to post it in the Energy Sense format (MDEF) would be very difficult because of how the system operates.   Pat also confirmed that they do not post data from all MV90 accounts to the MDMA on a daily basis.  I asked her if they could change this process and she said that it was something they have been wanting to do, but it has not been a high priority.   I recommend that we get the daily CSV file from the FTP server and import it into the Load Database that John Rutledge is developing.  Pat says that if we can have the Work Request completed today, we could have this set up next week.  The best scenario is for all the data to be posted to the MDMA daily, so we can possibly get CSC to make this a high priority. Maurice Diann, 	We have a few paths that we are looking into, including the one that we discussed w/ Maurice. Never at any time in that meeting did we decide not to look at the paths listed below. Does this mean that you have done nothing to facilitate these request to CSC?   				Chris Chris,  I thought that you and Michael met with Maurice the other day and decided a slightly different path.  Is that not the case?   Diann, 	I have got to get an update on the items below. Please send me your status on these items by close of business today.  									Chris Cc:	Frazier, Michael; Hart, Vivian; O'Neil, Murray P.; Ha, Kenny Diann, 	Do you have an update on the status of the other two items we discussed. 1)	CSC's ability to send all of our Calf. Customers files out to the FTP server as they do with the Energy Sense customers, along with the  timeline to get this implemented. 2)	The cost and timeline to put all of our customers into the Energy Sense website. Chris 503-807-8959 Cc:	Frazier, Michael; Hart, Vivian Vivian has regained access to the MDMA.    However, I need to control who has access so that we don't interfere with CSC's operation.  Let me know who will need access to this data.  Thanks. cc:	  Diann, 	I am flying back to Portland tomorrow morning at about 9:30 arriving at 12:00 Please call me at 503-807-8959 or e-mail me w/ and update on you talks w/ CSC. Thanks for your help. 									Chris Stokley
