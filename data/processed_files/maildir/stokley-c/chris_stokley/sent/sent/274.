Pamela, 	Where do you get the numbers for the EEMC tab? Here are the stages of the process that I currently know about: 	 		2) Calf. schedulers pull EES schedules into their portfolio and submit the information to the ISO. 		3) ISO sends back Day Ahead Finals (Changes could occur with EES original schedule) 		4) ISO Sends back Hour Ahead Finals (Changes could occur with EES schedule from the Day Ahead Market) 								Thanks 								  Chris cc:	  Thanks, Pam   <Embedded StdOleLink
