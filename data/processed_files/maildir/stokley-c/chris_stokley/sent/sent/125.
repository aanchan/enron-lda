Keoni, 	I realize that there are no penalty charges associated to Load, I am referring to the neg. and positive load deviation. What are all of the charges associated to the penalties for deviation from schedule.  	Ps  Jim, take your best cut at what you think these charges are and then get Keoni too sign off on what results you come up with. We need to put every charge that we think is linked to a schedule and then just have Keoni fill in the gaps and sign off on the document. 								Chris This is what Keoni says:  See below.  I have placed all the numbers on the Charge Names and am putting together a list of what is missing from this document. There are no "penalty charges" associated with loads, just the load deviation charges such as replacement reserves. http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/04/13/20000413073746684.pdf Keoni Almeida California Independent System Operator phone: 916/608-7053 pager:  916/814-7352 This is one request of Chris.  Is he talking about 403 with 111-116? Jim  I will ask Keoni about this.  Jim,  	We are missing one significant piece of info in this document.  We need to add the charges associated Positive and Negative  Load  Deviation (Penalty Charges). I don't think that there are any for  Positive Dev., but I know that there are charges associated to Neg.  Dev.  								Chris  		 << File: Activity Charges Keoni.doc   		There you go!  How is Houston?
