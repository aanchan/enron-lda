I guess this means our relationship comes to and end :( Cc:	Chatterton, Jill; Filer, Beverly Hello Everyone, Over the past week Debra Davidson and I have been discussing how to operate EWS from the administrative aspect since we have individuals from multiple groups within ENA.  As of today, I would like everyone's travel, expense reports, cell phones, and/or any other administrative needs to go through the following people. Beverly Filer is your Houston Administrative Assistant.  She is dedicated to providing EWS excellent administrative support while you are in Houston.  This includes preparing your expense reports, arranging meetings, powerpoint presentations, etc.  Beverly's phone number in Houston is 713/345-3134. Jill Chatterton is your Portland Administrative Assistant .  She is dedicated to providing our EWS group excellent administrative support, whether you are in Portland or Houston.  This includes preparing your expense reports, providing support with cell phones, arranging meetings, making travel arrangements, etc.  Jill's phone number in Portland is 503/464-8216. Please contact Jill and/or Beverly for ALL of your administrative assistant needs and refrain from asking your previous assistant for support.  Using Jill and Beverly as our assistants will mean they will have more information about our organization which will make them more effective for all of us.  If you have any questions, please contact me.
