Actually, I think the settlements group would have to have this number at an aggregate level to be able to potion FERC.  I would have to go into each spreadsheet and make that calculation.  An example would be for Jan. 1, the total charges were $2,053,504.

Cc:	Sheidun, Donna I confirmed that since Enron does not deviate from their schedules in real time a good portion of the payments have been going to Enron.  It is still up in the air what they will do with these charges.

Just thought I'd let you know.  I'll  keep after him first thing in the morning.
