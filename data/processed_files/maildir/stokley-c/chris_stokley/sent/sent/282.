Thank you Good morning, Chris. I apologize for not replying to you on Friday; I have been out of the office until today. The problem with the Publications container is a Yahoo issue, as they are the backbone to the portal.  I have spoken with our Portal administrator, and he is working to fix the problem with Yahoo.  As soon as it is back up and running, you will be one of the first to know. Thank you for your patience, Elizabeth Elizabeth, 	Why have you not resonded back to my e-mail?  			Chris     		 cc:	  Elizabeth, 	Any luck on fixing this problem?   Elizabeth, Could you look into this?  Thanks.     		 cc:	  It still does not work. Please forward this issue on to Elizabeth and have her take a look at it. If she needs to contact me I can be reached at 503-464-8219. 										Chris   cc:	  Please try again.
