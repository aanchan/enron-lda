Sorry for my tardiness on this issue, I was cleaning my e-mail today and realized that I never got back with you on this topic. Go w/ the original estimates for Valley to bill off of. The actuals variance from estimate is immaterial. If you have a question call me at 503-807-8959. give me a call on my cell 807-8928 I will give you a call tomorrow. Chris I need to get these numbers from you. Thanks, Paul  X3837
