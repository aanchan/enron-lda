Kristin, 	I apologize for being so tardy in responding to your e-mail. Get with Mary Vasquez to arrange a meeting sometime next week. 									Chris                                                                                                           Chris, Do you have availability on Monday afternoon or Tuesday to meet with the Project Genesys Business Architecture team?  Please let me know what days and times work well for you. Thanks, Kristin                                                                                                                       William S.

Mark identified you as EWS's manager responsible for Wholesale Settlements within the Risk Management Group. I would like to meet with you Thursday to ask a series of questions about this functional area. Please let me know when you can meet and I will schedule a conference room. Thanks, Scott P.S.
