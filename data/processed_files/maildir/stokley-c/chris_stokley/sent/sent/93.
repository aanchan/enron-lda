Tim Belden Chris, As part of independence issues, the requesting group / VP should be EES (i.e. not Enron Assurance).  Who would be appropriate? kl Ken, we need to identify who the VP over the requesting group is in the request.  Would this be Evan? cc:	  FYI, here is a copy of the work request I have forwarded to Jacqueline. Regards  << File: CSC Work Request.doc
