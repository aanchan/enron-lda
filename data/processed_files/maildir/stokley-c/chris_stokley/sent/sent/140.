FYI cc:	  Patricia G Priestley/CEG/CSC Attached is a summary of the impacted areas and a current status of Meter Operations due to Houston flooding: Meter reading and posting of data - We are currently unable to read/post interval data for California or Phoenix.  While the electricity has been restored, phone lines are still inoperable meaning we are unable to read phone or wireless meters.  Since the phone system to the building had extensive water damage, we are not sure when the lines will be available. Backup operations are being developed in Dublin but are not yet functional. Settlements for EEMC - Files for EEMC have been posted through Sunday, the 10th, for day 41, April 30.  Day 41 files for 5/1 due Monday, the 11th, and 5/2 due today, the 12th, have not been produced.  We are unable to communicate with our servers because of the phone outage and are therefore unable to create the files remotely.  Through today we have been denied access to  our building.  Our plan is to seek access on Wednesday at least long enough to generate our files and submit them remotely using a laptop. Settlements for EESO - Files for EESO have been posted through Sunday, settlement file 4/30 for day 41.  We are able to generate settlement files offsite and are working to submit Monday's 5/1 and Tuesday's 5/2 file by midnight today. My plan is to produce these daily updates until all of our operations are back in place and on schedule. Please contact me with any questions....pager 800.946.4646    pin# 1524013.
