Jennifer, 						             Thanks 							Chris Chris,  thanks for sending these files promptly.  However, there are a couple of zones and hours I need you the check in the EES file as the volume look a little inconsistent when compared to hours before and hours after.  Please check the following: Date		Zone		Hour 4/1		PGE1		14, 17 & 18 4/4		PGE1		11, 13 & 17 		PGE2		11 		PGE3		11&12 		SCE1		1, 11 - 17 4/5		PGE2		2-5 4/7		PGE3		13-15 & 18 4/11		PGE2		2-6 		PGE3		2-6 & 24 		SCE1		4, 5 & 24 Please let me know if  you have any questions. Thanks again, Pam <Embedded StdOleLink
