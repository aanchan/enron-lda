  Cc:  FYI?MO Cc:     Herrera, Juan Murray, thanks for your interest in leveraging the Gutenberg work.  Here's the draft Overview.  The visio documents are not the most current, but I've asked the consultants to produce a binder this morning and also e-mail you all of the most current process flows as well as the Pricing and Booking disconnect detail you requested. I 'd like very much to learn more how you would see expediting progress through the EWS processes and tools, and hope you'll work with us as soon as possible to see what might be possible.
