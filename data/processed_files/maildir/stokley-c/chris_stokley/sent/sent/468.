Jim, 	Could you look into this and let them know that they need to put you or someone else in the VM group on the contact list going forward. 			Thanks 			Chris Cc: Nichols, Newonda; Shore, Miranda Chris, I left a message on you answering machine last Thursday at 4:36 p.m. (PST) regarding higher loads noticed in PGE territory. I'm sending this email n case you're out for a period of time. I basically just noticed that load had risen above observed normal levels in knew why this was happening? On my phone message I also indicted that I had seen schedules going up as well and assumed that you may be picking up new customers. Thank you, David Alvarez Market Quality (916) 608-5915
