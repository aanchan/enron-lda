Keoni, 	Are you sure? It seems that we would have a charge or expense or both. I checked.  You had no charges for 4/13/01.

As far as the 4/29/01 file, you have finalized this and should be able to send it to me. 								Chris The file contained 04/18/01 thru 05/28/01. This is as far as we have finaled.  Dates prior to 04/18 were previously sent.
