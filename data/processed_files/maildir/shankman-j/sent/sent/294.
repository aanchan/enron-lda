How could I leave Tx?    Where are you looking for a house? That's exciting!   I'll start shopping for a house warming gift! Why are they moving?  Are you leaving Texas as well? I'm doing okay.  Did I tell you I bought a truck?  It's a 1500 dodge ram.   It's pretty neat.  I don't drive it in to work.  Parking is too expensive.   I'm in the considering buying a home.  My former landlord referred me to a  real estate agent.  I'd like to know how much house I can afford before I  start looking at property. Are you staying at your new house? hi there.  obedience school for the pup is a must.  max and chloe are moving  to connecticut tomorrow..  how's everything? Good morning. How are you?
