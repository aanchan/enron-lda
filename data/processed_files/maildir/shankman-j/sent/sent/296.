We must work on the housewarming!  I decided best to do it with no  furniture.  Early Feb I think.  N.O. sounds great.  Have I mentioned my head  may explode and that the video will be on "Amazing Home Videos" on the WB? poor you.  was it gross?  I hope that you had a great weekend.  I have a  crazy two days, then off to New Orleans until sunday for a conference.  I am  really excited, but I hate leaving town when I am so busy.  what did you do  this weekend?  oh...Harold wants to know when the house-warming is? I was in La Madel. this morning  (Sun) having coffee and juice, and I thought  for SURE I was going to see you there! I just spoke to my sister and she goes to the doctor on monday.  the baby's  heart is the size of a poppy seed, and the baby is the size of a bean.  she  and josh are calling it their "beanie baby."  isn't that cute? Have a great evening--I'm out of here! I know what you mean.  let's figure out when we both have some free time and  maybe we can go to a fun dinner and blow off some steam.   I think my head spun, then exploded.  Ditto on the busy part!  Trying to get  Max and Chloe ready for their departure Friday, meeting with contractors, and  work.  OY. happy new year!  I hope that you are having a great day.  my head is  spinning....I have so much to do, I don't know where to start!
