set up a quick (no more than 30 mins) about this with me, nowlan, reck.   thanks.  jeff Daniel Reck One of the tranport dot coms has asked if we could post diesel hedges on  their site.  I know we don't (maybe no one does) trade diesel.  But there is  a huge a need for this product in the transport world.  Any thoughts on how  to do this?   --Dan
