I'm not sure that thor understands dollars flowing with risk.  What should we  do with him?   Brent A Price fyi - it doesn't sound like the weather piece of the Oslo long-term deals is  going to have much value.  We are still trying to get that value from Oslo  and ensure that the weather risk is captured appropriately in EGM risk  books.  I will keep you updated. Thor Lien 26/09/2000 23:40 Brent This deal was done as a Power game and when we split it, the main value will  be on the power book, so don't calc on anything substantial on this Thor Brent A Price 26/09/2000 20:11 Thor - We are going to meet with Jeff Shankman on Thursday to discuss 3rd  Quarter earnings.  If we can get an idea by then of the value associated with  the weather piece of the Kotka deal it would be helpful.  Call me if you have  any concerns regarding this request.  Thanks for your help. Thor Lien 25/09/2000 23:41 Todd We haven't finalised the strip out of the remaining weather risk from the  power book, but we will surely send that over as soon as we have done it Thor     	 	 	 Bjarne and Thor, Thanks for the confirmation and other information that you provided on this  deal.  I still need the associated P&L and Weather Risk transferred from the  Nordic Power books to the Weather book. It is imperative that this be done immediately from a Risk controls  standpoint not to mention the fact that Quarter-end is fast approaching.   Please call or e-mail so as to update me of your progress. Thanks, Todd
