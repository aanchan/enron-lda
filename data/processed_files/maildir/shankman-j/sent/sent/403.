no interest.   Jeff, Please advice of your interest in Dave's experience. Thanks, Johnny     	 	 	 Charles - Potential candidate for Donahue, Dietrich or EIM.  Johnny - See if  there is anything in EGM that would be a fit.  Ted     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Ted, This is the resume of someone I know socially (through Houston Ballet Guild)  who happens to work for Azurix.  He, like so many others over there, really  would like to explore opportunities at Enron.  He has a very strong resume  and is someone I think we should really take a look at.  He realizes he may  have to take a step down to make the transition.  Who would you suggest we  forward him to? Thanks, Amy If you want Amy we could meet at 3:00 in my office or we can keep at the  coffee shop whichever you prefer. Dave Pruner 713-646-8329
