I was in La Madel. this morning  (Sun) having coffee and juice, and I thought  for SURE I was going to see you there! I just spoke to my sister and she goes to the doctor on monday.  the baby's  heart is the size of a poppy seed, and the baby is the size of a bean.  she  and josh are calling it their "beanie baby."  isn't that cute? Have a great evening--I'm out of here! I know what you mean.  let's figure out when we both have some free time and  maybe we can go to a fun dinner and blow off some steam.   I think my head spun, then exploded.  Ditto on the busy part!  Trying to get  Max and Chloe ready for their departure Friday, meeting with contractors, and  work.  OY. happy new year!  I hope that you are having a great day.  my head is  spinning....I have so much to do, I don't know where to start!
