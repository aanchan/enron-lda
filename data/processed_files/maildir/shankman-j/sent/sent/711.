I sat with him in my office and made some changes, then I think you did as  well.  I'm ok to proceed.  thanks.  Jeff Jeff, If you have a minute, can you give me a call/email and let me know what you  decided as far as the GasTech Presentation?  Alhamd called for my revisions  and I told him they were with your's, but he didn't receive them.  Did you  want to go forward with any of those slides I suggested?  Otherwise, I'll  tell Alhamd it was fine.  I'll drop you a voice-mail to the same effect. Thanks, Merritt Mobile:  713.806.9078 Home:  713.807.9756 enjoy...
