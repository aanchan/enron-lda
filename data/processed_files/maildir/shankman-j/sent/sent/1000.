we need to proceed with pricing this, but let's help these guys understand.   Eric thought you might want to see this.  Obviously Brad can tell you more if  you are interested. Regards, Merritt Merritt, Call me to hear the latest about the Northwest Shelf deal.  V V  left me a  message saying that he would still let us "work on the pricing, structuring  side", but that he's been kicking his bid around with Wayne, Clay and Rick  and they're going to put together their own idea.  Gee, are you getting the  impression that they don't get it?  They seem to want to go long on  Australian cargoes by bidding at a price that would only make economic sense  if it goes into India.  They're not going to go through us to get there.   They didn't comprehend that to take a long position means that you are  putting that position in a book.  I'm going to lose it.
