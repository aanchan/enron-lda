print Stuart Staley A brief summary of stats from the month of December.  Volumes were off a bit  from November, reflective of the seriousness with which members of the  coal/shipping community take the holiday season - however, exponential growth  from summer period continues.  This has exacerbated systems and back office  problems we have been having for the past year, thus internal focus during Q1  will be on this issue. Stu     	 	 	   Rgds   Patryk
