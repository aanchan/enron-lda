please print As you know, we are preparing a new LNG brochure that will be rolled out at  the Gastech Conference in Houston mid November.  Many of you have submitted  comments that are hopefullyincluded herein.  Attached is the latest draft of  the brochure text.  Please review this very carefully and submit your  comments to Henry Means/Zdenek Gerych by Tuesday noon.   I have scanned this and have noted at least several typos and some  numerical/statistical errors.  AG, please check in particular the DPC/Metgas  stuff. Henry/Z, the purpose of this brochure is to communicate that the market is  changing and that Enron is leading the transformation of this industry.   However, there is a negative tone in parts of this that is a slap in the face  to the major oil companies and the government companies particularly in the  Mid east and Far East.  I want to get all negatives out---anything that a  supplier could read as an insult will come back to bite us.  The message  should be bold but positive, with no implied insults. I look forward to reading the next draft Tuesday evening Rick Dennis Vegas Attached is the draft as promised. This reflects input from several members  of the team. It is easy to read and flows well. Please review and share you  feedback by Wed before noon ( no later, sorry). Once complete, we will  circulate the final with your comments. I do need the name of the lawyer that  would approve the final draft for the LNG team.  Hope you had a good trip back.
