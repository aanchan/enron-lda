Jennifer got ME a gift cert. to urban retreat.  How nice is that?  She loved  her gift from me--the bucke on the purse was the same color turquoise eye  shadow she has--crazy!  How's Alexandras' sales today?   it talked about Net Works.  you are at the bottom of the page where it talks  about Global. So I looked on the dec 15 issue--where did you see my name?  Chloe was asking  about you this morn!  Dog's go on winter break Jan 5--so hopefully before  then.   your name looked great in eBiz this morning.  I am very prould of you! I crashed last night.  When can I come back to play with Chloe?
