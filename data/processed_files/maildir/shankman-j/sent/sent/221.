Unfortunately I will not be able to attend.  I will be in London. Regards Jeff A few weeks ago, we sent you a letter extending an invitation to a cocktail  Lounge on January 25. We've not heard back from you as to whether or not you can attend either or  both special events planned for the directors attending the Association of  Art Museum Directors' meeting in Houston next week. Could you please let me know as soon as possible if you plan to attend either  or both of these special events! Thanks.
