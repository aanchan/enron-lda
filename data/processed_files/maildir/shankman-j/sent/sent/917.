print fyi---this article has gone to press and will be published shortly by Poten &  Partners.   ======================================== Dear Rick and Clay: I thought you you would be interested in a "look-in-advance" at the article about Enron LNG to be published by POTEN in this month's LNG IN WORLD MARKETS.   Clay, sorry I missed you this time around in September when I was in the Middle East.  For your guidance, we heard a lot of nice things from OLNG management about you guys -- and well deserved I may add. Best regards, Gabriel F.
