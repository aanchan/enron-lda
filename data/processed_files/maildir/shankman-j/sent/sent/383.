please print Sarah Mulholland Attached are the weekly IB reports.  Since I'm in London there will be no  hard copies this week and hopefully it will be up on the EGM Website this  afternoon.  If you'd like copies of the full reports themselves, please just  email me and I'll figure out a way to get them to you.  Everyone have a great  holiday. Sarah
