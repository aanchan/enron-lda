Can you include Bill White, Pavel Z, Rob Fuller, Chris Mahoney, Niamh Clarke,  and the rest of the crude team on this types of reports.  Thanks.  Jeff 	Clayton Seigle 		  	 Word today is that the Saudis are committed to defending $25 OPEC basket/$28  WTI.  They are likely to endorse a further reduction in the OPEC quota of up  to 1 million b/d at the March meeting, if the data at that time supports such  a move.
