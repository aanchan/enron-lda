yes me and mike.  thanks. I was researching something on Eric and noticed that he is assigned to the  expat payroll which I think is correct.  He is also assigned to EEL, John  Sheriff which I think is incorrect.  I have asked Kim to leave him on the expat payroll, but pointing  organizationally to you and McConnell in EGM rather than Sheriff in EEL --  correct? Shanna
