Thanks.  I'll be away for a few days, and get back with you next week.  Jeff 		  BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE IN THE FERTILIZER INDUSTRY (SOURCING AND SELLING TO  ENRON'S WEBSITE.  THERE IS AN OPENING IN THE "WHOLESALE, RETAIL & COMM ENERGY  HUMAN RESOURCE DEPT, THEY WILL BE CONFUSED BY MY ENTERTAINMENT / FERTILIZER  EXPERIENCE.  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU IF THERE IS ANYONE YOU KNOW, AT ENRON  NY, THAT I CAN MEET WITH PERSONALLY.  IN A MEETING I CAN EXPLAIN MY  EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS BETTER THAN I CAN IN MY RESUME.  I WAS VERY  GOOD AT SOURCING CLIENTS AND ESTABLISHING LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS FOR  FERTILIZERS AND BELIEVE THAT I CAN TRANSFER THAT SKILL TO ENERGY. BEST REGARDS, RINA
