Why is she not being promoted down there, or staying within that  organization??? Jeff/Gary: Are you aware of any management opportunities for Tracee's experience?   Please advise. Thanks, Johnny 54017     	 	 	 Please run her resume by the EGM heads to find out their interest level.   Thanks. Shanna, Cindy; Tracee is an ESA associate who is ready to promote out of the program into a  manager level position.  Could you take a look at her resume for potential  opportunities within EGM/EIM?  Thank you. Janie Janie, Per our telephone conversation, I am attaching my resume for your review. As  we discussed, I am seeking a permanent (Manager level) position where my  finance and origination skills would be best leveraged.  I am very interested  in a role in financing and/or orginating energy deals - wholesale or retail.   If you or one of the groups interested in interviewing me require a  reference, please contact my current supervisor, Rob Gay, or current and  former colleagues Peter Anderson and Greg Blair, respectively.  Thanks again for your help and advice. Regards, Tracee  x5-5688
