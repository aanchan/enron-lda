absolutely.  plus it's a great selling point for us to have an opportunity in  NY.   Sarah Mulholland Jeff, per my conversation with Caroline, it looks like they might like and  could use an intern this summer in NY.  I think with both her and Per it  would be a good experience, what do you think? sarah geez- nothing stays quiet in this place!!  i'd have plenty of stuff for a  summer intern to do- also per is up here w/ syndication, softs, metals,  credit, etc.... waiting for approval on Mog how's resid?? thats a very, very good idea.  i will consider that big time.  sure you will  have enough stuff to keep them busy? so you can't get out for one day of interviews in march?  btw, i heard you  asked mog to come up to ny to help out.  very good choice, whats the status? sarah hey - i will not be able to get out- if one of the candidates would like to  be in the NY office for the summer, we could probably arrange that..
