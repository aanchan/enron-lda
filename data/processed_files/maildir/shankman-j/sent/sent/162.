Congrats!.  Will get you involved.  Jeff 	Cheryl Lipshutz 		  Jeff, I met with you in the fall & mentioned that my son had applied early  acceptance to Penn for undergraduate.  In the craze of year end closings, I  neglected to let you know that he got accepted this past December.  He is  very excited & I am excited that the stress level in our house over college  apps is over!!!  In any event, I would like to take as active a role as  possible on the Penn/Wharton recruiting team.  Please let me know how I can  help.  Thanks!
