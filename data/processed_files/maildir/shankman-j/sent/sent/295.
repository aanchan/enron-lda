I have incorporated  the comments I have received so far (although I have deleted a bit on the  shipping slide on the EGM portion because it was duplicative).  Because this  needs to be printed/bound by early tomorrow morning, I would ask that all  changes to this presentation be given to me by no later than 3:30 london  time.   The final presentation will have background graphics but i have removed them  for now to enable easier emailing. Thank you. -Tiffany
