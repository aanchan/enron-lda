fyi Michael J Beyer Guys There has been tremendous interest expressed already by generators,  developers, and utilities to just about every coal producer about locating  plants at mines. Some are moving forward. The most advanced appear to be  Peabody (into TVA in western KY) EnviroPower (permitting three sites in Ky  and Indiana) and Anker (permitting a site in W.Va). All sites are near  transmission. We can help locating sites , reserves and producers near transmission if we  knew where the power needs are. Mike
