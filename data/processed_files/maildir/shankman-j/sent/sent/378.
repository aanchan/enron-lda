please put in rolodex Jeff, Great to meet you this morning.  I enjoyed learning about the directions that you have Enron moving in and I look forward to continuing discussions with you in the new year.  It was also nice to exchange notes with someone who shares the collecting bug. Have a good time out west and don't let Michael and Halley con you into more cold weather fishing. Thanks for breakfast, Nat Nathaniel Jeppson Vice President Allen & Company Incorporated 711 5th Avenue New York, NY  10022 (212) 339-2557
