Tom Piazze is the Director of Corporate relations at Wharton.  215 898 1615.   Use my name Jeff, Where does Tom Piazze work (Enron)?  Or is he a contact at the school.  There  is a Tara Piazze in the phone directory. Kristin What do we need to do to be involved.  Kristin, can you call Tom Piazze and  ask him what he thinks Looks like they've got good participation from IBs.  The fact that they are  having it at one of the most expensive places in the city leads me to believe  that they are putting a lot of effort into strong attendance and putting  together a good conference.  Of course that is also why sponsorship is so  expensive.  Do you want me to take care of signing us up?  Jeff, any ideas  for panelists? Michele Nezi Marvin Manager Enron Broadband Services (713)853-6848 	Please respond to sureshb 		  Hi Michele thanks for getting back to me with regards to the finance conference. I am in the process of collecting the committed speaker list. Just wanted to give you a flavor for kind of people that we are targeting. The major committed sponsors so far are some of the top investment banks (Chase, Merrill Goldman, MSDW) and we are lining up the either heads of investment banking, asset management or some well know research analysts from these firms to adress the panelists and the conference attendees. I will have specific names for you in a couple of days are we are still in the process of confirming speakers. The conference will be at the Park Hyatt in Center City along with the Bullish on Finance reception the previous day. This conference will be a good platform for Enron to talk about its unique position in trading and can utilize the Sales and Trading panel to expose the students and the conference attendees to Enrons capabilities and the firm in general. I will provide you with more information in the coming days and I sincerely hope you will choose to sponsor one of the panels and have a strong presence at the finance conference this year. Regards Suresh 215-893-9491  cc:  Here is another conference we can participate in.  Would you  rather do this  conference or the entrepreneurship conference?  Kristin  10/04/2000 08:55  cc:  Hi Kristin  I am following up on our conversation earlier with respect to Enron  participating in the Whartons Finance conference and the evening  reception known as Bullish on Finance.  I think this forum will be a great opprotunity for Enron to reach  the students interested in finance and it also provides a great platform  to talk about Enrons unique position in the global financial  community.  Please do consider the option of sponsoring a panel at the Gold level.  It provides a great value and essentially a full panel "ownership" to  talk about Enrons acitivities.  I would like to touch base with you early next week to hear you thoughts  and feedback on these proposals.  Looking forward to a great conference participation.
