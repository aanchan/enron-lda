I have some real concerns over this contract Louise put together for  Jonathan.  Shanna, can you check this out with Robert Jones.  I'd like to  restructure this contract.   Jeff 		  Jeff, Attached is the term sheet we put together for Jonathan Whitehead: Please give me a call if you have any questions. Thanks, Robert I have had some discussions with Jonathan and recommended he takes the LNG  job offered.  Assuming he does, we have already set out the terms for him  coming over (fully negotiated) so there is nothing to do on the HR side  provided you are happy with the numbers. Louise ps Robert please send Jeff the Jonathan numbers.
