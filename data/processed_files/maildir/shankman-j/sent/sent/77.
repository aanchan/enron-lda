Philippe, this has been going on for a while.  Can you address this right  away?  Thanks.   Jeff 	George McClellan 		  Can't get bigger with lousy IT support in London.  This has been an issue for  some time.  Lot's of people look concerned -but not too much improvement.     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe 	 	 as usual we were the first group in london to spot that the enron server in  houston was having some problems and a big back log of messages (for good  reasons as we were anxiously awaiting  an incoming message which never came  on one of our ship which is in a delicate situation). why on earth is it that we don t get a warning that there is a problem so  that we can tell our customers, suppliers to use direct fax line s or other  means of communications  . in this instance the long awaited message was  worth 60 000 usd but could have been much more . pierre
