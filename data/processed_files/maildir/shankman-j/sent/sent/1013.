please print.  also make a folder for enron india.  thanks. Mike/Jeff:  you need to intervene on this at a higher level to make sure that  we don't give up any important LNG rights when we selldown DPC     	enron india 	 	 Clay, we've been banging this drum so long in India that we've broken all our  drumsticks. We've always maintained that access to the Metgas terminal and  storage and pipeline is key to any plans Enron has in the LNG business.  Personally, I have always thought Enron should just finance and build the  pipeline itself and then sell it once it becomes operational, maintaining  access to the terminal and pipeline capacity. Glad to see you're on board,  because we can use the help.  But this is going to require some Enron commitment. To meet Enron's  objectives (no debt consolidation, cash flow and earnings), the current  selldowns being considered are to industry and related players who want their  share of the upsides of the business. So giving Enron any preferred rights is  going to be tough with these players. Let's discuss next week in India. I have requested the Metgas meetings with  the EGM LNG team be on Wednesday. Clay Harris One of the keys to growing the LNG business is access to LNG terminals and  fuel supply opportunities. We should insure that the sell down of DPC and  Metgas be structured such that Enron/EGM retain terminal rights and fuel  supply rights at Dabhol, if appropriate. The Metgas terminal/regas rights  under the TARA and EFI's fuel management/fuel supply rights under the Fuel  Management Agreement need to stay with Enron/EGM. Lets discuss next week in  Mumbai. Clay
