I believe this was suppossed to be a much bigger deal.  There was some  confusion between CES and Eagle Point and it ended up just being more or less  and exchange deal on ANR and a transport deal on CGAS. Chris, Everything looks fine with the deal except the volumes.  The information that  CES gave us had at least twice as much volume on both of those tickets.  Do  they have the right to swing like that? Dave Chris Germany deals 136749 & 149838 Thanks Buddy     	 	 	 Chris, Can you please give me the Sitara number on this deal. Thanks, David     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Chris Germany Per John Grass - CES sold Eagle Point gas on ANR (deal 136749) at ANR IF  +.01.  and bought Eagle Point gas on CGAS (deal 149838) at CGAS IF +.005. The sale to Eagle Point is in Sitara.  I just added the purchase deal on  CGAS, it was not in Sitara.  Per John - Eagle Point is guaranteed to recover  the ANR variable cost plus $.02.
