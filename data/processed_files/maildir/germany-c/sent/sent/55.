Can you find me a woman?  You know I'm still sorta single. Good bye Portland, Hello India. I got this reply from Bhavna. Hi Scott, India is great!  We have setteled so well here.  The staff at Baroda office  are very friendly,  I just love it here, it is so peaceful.  Children love  the open space, all the rides on camel,scutoor, rikshas.   I have found couple of spots here for you and Chris, just hop on the plane,  you will not regrate it.   Have a wonderful weekend.  Can't wait to see the capacity trading page.   Bhavna How is India?  Any openings for Chris Germany or me?   Scott
