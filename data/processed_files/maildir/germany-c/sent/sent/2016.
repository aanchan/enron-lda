I don't know if this was ever resolved but Susan Pereira's name is on the  deal ticket.     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Skippy and Chris, I am not in the loop on the Formosa deal...... sg Can you please help Client Services out on the pricing for Formosa  Plastics/Sport Pipelline.     	 	 	 Elizabeth...  Can you tell us if the terms of the Formosa Plastics/Sport  Pipeline deals have changed?  The terms USED to be Formosa got the first  15,000/day (deal 229875), Sport deal #244626 got the next 5,000/day and Sport  deal #244627 took the swing.  There have been new deals set up in Sitara for  November production that don't mirror that.  Formosa deal #463959 starts on  day 4 (what happened to days 1-3?) and gets the first 15,000/day.  Sport deal  # 456694 covers days 1-3 but the prices are tiered to include what looks like  Formosa's volume.  Sport deal #463958 covers the rest of the month but the  prices don't mirror the first 3 day's prices.  Do you see a problem here??!! Help!! ...Chuck
