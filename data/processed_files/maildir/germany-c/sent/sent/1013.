I've been in you house since then.  I also have a doggie book in the back of  my car that belongs to you. You haven't seen me since Thanksgiving Day...you don't want to break your  record now..... C'mon - I want a free lunch.  I could interduce you to a new place, real  close to work. No, 'cause you can't type! I think I might call.  Would you take me our for a free lunch?
