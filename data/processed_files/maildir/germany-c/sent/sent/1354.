You go girl! This has been, and still is a serious problem.  There are some reports and  information I can't get to  now because of it.  I'm working with Transco on it.   Bev Chris Germany I didn't have this email when I left yesterday. Chris and Judy, Please pass on to any of your folks who need to know that we've completed the name change from Enron Cap & Trade to Enron North America.  Your new business party number is 7973. Let me know if any problems arise.  Thanks.   ii
