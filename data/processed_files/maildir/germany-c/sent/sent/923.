S x5-7213 Scott Hendrickson Well, just in that amount of time, I found out more about the deal.... I was inherited from CES.  CES had originally made the sale and when we  bought their book of business, we ended up with that sale.  You may want to  speak with Chris Germany about it, he was very involved with the CES  assimilation. Scott
