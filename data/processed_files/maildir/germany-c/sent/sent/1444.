I thought you were taking care of all that Tiger??     	 	 	 Colleen has signed the letter and it has been FedX for arrival at TCO  tomorrow. Susan Wade is presently upset that we are using Team 3 and not her  Team. She  overheard Chris Germany talking to Steve Stonestreet today. She overheard  Cindy Burnette working on Union Camp for me yesterday. We need someone from  Enron to smooth this over with her. Please decide who will be giving Susan Wade the courtesy call about the  change. Not sure what timing is best... today or tomorrow. Thank you.
