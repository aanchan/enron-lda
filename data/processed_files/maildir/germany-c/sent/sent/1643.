I also tried searching for just "Burt" and "Bert" and nothing came up with the last name sounding, feeling, looking, or smelling like a "shears". cc: When you have time can you see if you have a phone number (somewhere at Enron) for Burt Shears.  A lady I work w/ needs it.   (it is a friend of hers - I think.) thanks                     Vicki S.
