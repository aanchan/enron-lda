If this is metered production then its not cut (it just flows to the pool).   If its pool gas then it probably is cut, so you tell me.  Metered production  or pool gas on CNG?     	 	 	 Why was this gas cut?? My Phone number is 330-493-7790. John I took the volume on deal 226742 (Devonian Resources) to 0 for April.   Hey John, give me a call when you get a chance so we can chat about this.   Also, send me your phone number.  I can't find it.
