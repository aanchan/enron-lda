713-646-8453 It is a CES deal.  I have some support that Cindy faxed me.  What is your fax  number and I'll send it to you. Thanks for your help Laurie     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 I just left Cingy a message  - I said that I'm not aware of any imbalance  trades that we intiated.  However, it could have been done by CES or EES.  I  asked her to call me back. Chris, I am still trying to get these imbalance trades resolved.  John Bieltz  is no longer with Amereda Hess but Cindy Wernecke has been working this  issue.  She can be reached at (703) 317-2293.  Can you please get back to me  as soon as possible as they would like to resolve. Thanks Laurie Laurie Ellis No, I still haven't gotten anywhere on this.  My contact at Amereda Hess  (formerly Statoil) is John Bieltz.  His number is 703-317-2318 and his email  Laurie I'm sorry I have not responded sooner.  Any new developement on this?  To my  knowledge, ENA has not done any imbalance trades.  Do you have a contact at  Statoil?  I can call and try to get more info.  It could be some CES thing we  were not aware of. Chris, do you have any information on an imbalance trade with Statoil on CNG  Niagara Mohawk for January and April 2000?  Statoil has been very patient  awaiting payment on this, but I cannot seem to find anything.  Gloria  Barkowsky suggested that I talk to you.  Thanks for your help. Laurie Ellis
