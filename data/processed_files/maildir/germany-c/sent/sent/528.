Steve, would you take care of this please? thanks Hi Chris, I sent a manual invoice to Oglethorpe today for Doyle.  The deal (Jim Homco's  spreadsheet) ties to Unify for the demand charges and the commodity charge.   Can you enter a deal in Sitara for the cashout?  Please give me a call at  3-4561. Thanks Darla
