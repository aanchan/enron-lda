Send me a new download, I want to see if the changes worked. Thanks Any updates???     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 I added the demand charges but I still need one of my Transco schedulers to  remove the volumes "actualized" on the 9th.   Please let me know when you are finished with this. Thanks! Mr. Germany - following are my notes per info Darla sent me: Invoice corrections:  Purchases on 4/9 should be zero.  Transport charge is OK =  $11,274.31  I do not see the demand charge in the invoice...  Also need to add a credit cashout for 12dt's at cashout price. I will be back in on Wednesday.  Thanks Darla for sending this - don't let Mr Germany - slack off next week. sorry! I think I referred someone to you that called me about Ormet.  Sorry!  I got  confused about ormet/oglethorpe.  Bad Morning! Thanks Darla
