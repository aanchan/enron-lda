When ENA purchased CES's book of business they acquired local production  behind the citygate.  This is one of those deals.  I did this deal with Chris  Germany of ENA.  If you need more information please let me know.  Thanks!  md Anate Kor Hey Marde! Our system shows we purchased this gas from ENA.  However, ENA does not have  this in their system.
