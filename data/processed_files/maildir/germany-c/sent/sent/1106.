You de' Woman!! Susan W Pereira I'm aware of the expiration date and plan to have legal send a termination  letter in May. Susan Chris Germany The Egan storage contract expires on August 31,200.  This is an evergreen  contract which will automatically renew for 12 months unless either party  gives 90 day written notice to end the contract.   I believe it will probably be one of you three looking at this.  Which one of  you is it? I left a copy of the contract on Susan's desk.  Susan, you can toss this.
