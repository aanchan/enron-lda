I just had a thought.  Just to keep you guys in the loop, I will send this  type of stuff to you unless you tell me not too.  You don't need to do  anything with it.  Its more of an awareness type thing. Chris Germany I just changed the rate on Algon/transport usage deal 233358 from $.26 to  $.0206.  We should get back 155,000 x $.2394 == $37,000 tonight.
