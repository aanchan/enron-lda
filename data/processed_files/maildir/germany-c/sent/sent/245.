Correction on the 4,018 dth from CPA (offer #30496), the receipt point is  Broad Run, not Leach. Chris Germany I meant the top 4 contracts Chris Germany You are correct.  The top 3 contracts were released to CES and the bottom one  is released to ENA.  I will execute all of them and re-release the CES's  contracts to ENA. Everything looks fine with one exception.  The contract at the bottom (K#  61825) should have already been in ENA's name starting Nov-00 through  Oct-2001.  PLEASE CONFIRM THIS . mhg x35488 Michael H Garred Jeff, can you verify the mdq's in yellow below?  Do we have to take the Gulf  capacity per the LDC? CHRIS -- JEFF HAS IS NOW ON THE NETWORK.  HE CANNOT NOT RECIEVE EMAILS SENT  TO HIS OLD ADDRESS. Call me when you get a chance.  There is some new capacity to execute for  November.  Expiring contracts are show in purple, the new contracts are shown  in yellow.  Ignore the demand charges for now, I did not verify them.  I  won't execute these until I hear from you. The capacity listed below was purchased from the pipeline.  Scott said Jeff  gave us the OK on this one.
