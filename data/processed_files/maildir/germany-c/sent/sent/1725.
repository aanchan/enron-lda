I'll ask my woman her opinion about my rock hard stomach.  I'm sure she will  agree after I tell her what to see.  I guess women can be sensitive. Ingrid's fine - and you?  How's your man? My last response didn't make sense... now that I re-read it. I meant to see I like a cat personality better. I'm sorry about the cushy remark... I'm guessing you have worked out a lot... since I last saw you. It's probably rock hard now. So how is ingrid?? cc: I'm guessing your stomach is nice and cushy.... not rock hard. Your women... ingrid??? I'm not getting a hamster!!! They have no personality like a cat. cc: I planted 50 plus flowers this weekend in my flower boxes. They look so pretty. I hope I don't kill them. I'm going to find me some kittens in the next few weeks. I'm lonely without Miss Muffy. Cindy Vachuska is coming to visit me in two weekends. I'm taking May 4th off.. we are going to do some museums, day to the eastern shore, and baltimore's inner harbor. Bidweek is such a joy!!! We are suppose to be back online with y'all... so they say. cc: See.... I'm being nice and not asking any other questions. Hope you're doing okay.
