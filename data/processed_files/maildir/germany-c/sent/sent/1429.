I took the CGAS deal 157147 volume to 0 and created TRCO deal 157182. This was my fault, I mistakenly bought the gas I thought Heidi needed.  I'm redirecting the gas to BGE. Heidi Boyd what is this?? did Fred request this? cc: Heidi, i have scheduled the 1000dth delivery to 30cs-34 for 1/28 only. k64231/123 thanks joann
