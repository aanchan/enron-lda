oh it is not.  You Lie! MARY THERESA FRANKLIN DONE Chris Germany Terry, please call Jack Meyers (304-623-8811) at CNG Transmission and have  these meters moved from CES/CEM pools to Enron's pools.  I think all you need  to do is send CNG a letter  requesting;    "Please move all meters flowing into contract 8G0A61 to contract 8G0011". If CNG needs meter information, maybe you could send them the statement they  send to Gloria,  I believe CES/CEM has 11 contracts.   Let me know if you have any questions. thanks Chris Germany The CES/CEM CNG Appalachian production is still flowing into the CES/CEM  gathering and transmission contracts.  Unless someone objects I would like to  get this moved over to Enron's pool.  We don't need to have the gathering and  transmission contracts moved over. Comments/questions?
