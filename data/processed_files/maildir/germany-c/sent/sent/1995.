Its ok to do the netout.  The volumes on deals 502957 and 456379 need to be  changed but I think that will be handled by Volume Management after they  enter the pipeline statements in Unify. If we've already discussed this excuse me. I just wanted to verify with you  that New Power was okay in the system (download I sent you) so I can do the  netout with them for this month.  Please let me know asap. Thanks Darla
