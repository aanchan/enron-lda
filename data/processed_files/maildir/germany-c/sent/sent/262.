Give me a copy of the invoice. thanks Brenda H Fletcher We do get invoiced by VGS.  The Transport contract numbers are VGS01026-IT  and VGS01033 - FTS-2     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Brenda, VGS is all buy/sells for us.  VGS delivers directly into Koch, CGULF  and TETCO.  We sell at the point or deliver into those 3 pipes where we pick  up on transport.    FTS-2 and IT sounds like Columbia Gulf..Thanks Brenda H Fletcher Nothing is getting flashed on VGS for commodity.  We are paying commodity  charges on a FTS-2 and an IT contract.  Can you get rates on the usage  tickets for these contracts? Thanks, Brenda
