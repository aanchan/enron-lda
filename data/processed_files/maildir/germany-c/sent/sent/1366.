Chris: I just want to thank you for helping me out when we were chatting last night....I look forward to chatting again. If you get the name of the IT manager I will definately not mention your name....I understand completely..... I hope we can talk again..I'm free this evening, so I'm sure I'll be online. Have a great day. Renee'
