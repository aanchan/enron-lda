I killed deal 396265 and added the demand charge to deal 124109. Chris Germany I entered a demand charge on deal 396265.  This is a Market East desk deal.   I tried to enter a demand charge on the original deal for Oct 1999 but I kept  having problems saving the deal so I created a new one. Let me know if this works. Brenda H Fletcher Do you know the deal number for this October 1999 demand fee? Brenda Can you push this demand item through Unify?     	 	 	 I just spoke with Chris, he's going to put the deal into sitara as a parking  demand for the October 1999 for $10,153.82. Thanks! Chris Germany Good job Chris. My contact at Iroq is out of the office.  When she gets back, I will agree to  pay $10,153.82 per my worksheet.  Let me know what would be the best way to  enter this in Sitara.  I think she is back in the office next week.  I also  think she will agree to my numbers just to get this resolved.  However, she  may just want us to pay what I think we owe while she does her own research.   Comments?
