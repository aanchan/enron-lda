I don't remeber, who was taking care of changing the CES counterparties?  Was  that someone in Global? Brenda H Fletcher Chris is the CES expert .     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 The contract for Hunt Petroleum has been assigned from CES to Enron.  I need  someone to change the names on deals 136863, 135898 and 136845 from CES-Hunt  Petroleum to Hunt Petroleum (without CES).  All of the deals are on the East  desk.  Let me know if this request is to go to one of you or if I need to  forward this to someone else. Thanks, Megan
