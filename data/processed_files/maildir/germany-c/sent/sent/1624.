Marianne Stiles Here are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.   Please do not forget that January 1 and January 2 will be lower because of the weekend/holiday.    I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not have that for all Tennessee Zn 6 markets until Monday, 12/27.  We will need a range from 2800 dth to 3600 dth per day.   This large swing is normal for  these types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.  - tn012000.xls
