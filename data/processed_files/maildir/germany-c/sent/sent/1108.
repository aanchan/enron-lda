Mary Theresa Franklin will be working on all the gathering stuff.  She and I  will be getting together tomorrow afternoon at 12:30.  Actually, you could  set the priorities for us.  What should we work on first? Brenda H Fletcher Are you planning on working on the gathering contracts or is someone else  going to enter? Chris Germany I would change it to an IT gathering contract.  I didn't know we had any firm  gathering in the Market area.  And currently, I am not working on the other  gathering contracts.   Brenda H Fletcher The invoiced rate on this contract is for  interruptible gathering but the  information on the deal reflects a Firm contract. How do you suggest handling  so the contract type, rate schedule and firmness are consistent with the  pipeline? Also, there are 10 contracts that we were invoiced for processing charges  that are not on the Service List in Path Manager for Feb. Are you working on getting contracts and deals added? Thanks, Brenda
