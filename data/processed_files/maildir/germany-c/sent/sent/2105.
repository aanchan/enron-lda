Cindy, take all the M2 production gas into our M2 tabs and lets go long in  the pool.  We will sell the gas over the holidays or next week after we see  what Dominion is producing.  We will not have this gas for January.     	 	 	 Guys, The well-head gas that we were moving IT from the M2-30" has been cut to zero  effective 12/21/00 forward.
