There is only a small chance that I will attend.  Vic, make sure and/or Angie  go. Sorry Chris, I'm too efficient!  You told me to set it up and I did!   can get a conference room big enough for everyone.  Thanks!  md CNG would like to stop by the office to do some TTT training next Wed, Thur,  or Fri.   Please let Marde know if you have a preference as to which day you would like  to meet with CNG.  I may or may not be here. Thanks
