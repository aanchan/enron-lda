No back surgery yet.  Second opinion Dr. said "let's just wait for 3 months  and see what happens.  We can always do the surgery." I liked that idea.   Give Mom and Dad a big hug for me. You are the best!!! Did you have your back surgery yet??? I forgot about that... I hope you're okay. I'm going on vacation too... April 11 to 16... see Mom and Dad in Colorado!!! Have a splendid day!!! cc: I need a correct answer to my question... I know you will not lead me a stray. If I buy onshore, take it through mainline, take it through leach, and take it to a delivered gate on TCO. Do I just pay GRI  once at TCO delivered point. If I drop it off in TCO pool, then I pay the GRI there?? I can't seem to get a straight answer from my accountants and TCO. It looks like our model is adding the GRI at each leg... opps. Thank you sweetie!!!! How's your bidweek... mine sucks!!!
