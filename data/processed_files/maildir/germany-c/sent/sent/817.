Do you have a home for the T&F Explor behind Penn Fuel for June?   I left a message for Charlie at CES this morning about all the other citygate  production.  I'm also trying to get a bid from CNG for the month of June on  the EOG and  Peoples gas.  I'll keep you posted.     	 	 	 Do you have a current Citygate production worksheet?
