Please discuss this with Morgan.  I didn't know CGV had a delivery point off  Transco. Heidi Boyd cc: Hi Noel and Paul, I don't know who else to copy on this, please forward it to them and cc me if you don't mind. I need   498 dth's/day total to be sent to CGV  for three of my customers  in Jan 2000.   Thanks!
