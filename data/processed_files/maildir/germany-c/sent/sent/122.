I might be able to get to it tomorrow if its a slow bid week, if not, then by  Wed of next week.  Hi Chris, Please give me a call this afternoon and let me know if you've had a chance  to look over the deals for october that Mary Ellenberger emailed to you last  week. I would like to get this matter resolved this week.  Thanks Darla
