Read below, are you interested? Chris: Milton Beattie called me about this, and on the second call, he said this was  currently being utilized by ENA via the Columbia Energy acquisition.  If ENA  still wants this, could you have the appropriate party call Milton Beattie at  the number below. Jim James T Javins Willard Kinzer, via his wholly owned LDC Belfry Gas, has 142/day of firm  transport available on 8/1/2000 for one year, which delivers into TCO.  He  has released and sold this in the past, as he has his own supply that he uses  to feed his Belfry Gas market.  (Kinzer is the largest independent producer  in Kentucky, with about 18,000/day). His agent, Milton Beattie, would like to know if we want to bid on this small  piece of firm transport.  He  can be reached at 1-606-679-8812. Call me or him if interested, and either way, please let me know. Jim
