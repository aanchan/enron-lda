According to the CES Data Room book, the price on this deal is IF CGAS +  .015.  I changed it in Sitara effective Jan 1, 2000 - Nov 30, 2001. Robin, Tom Clark at PG&E called and is not taking the 4400/day for April 2000. Chris and Scott, please check deal ticket 145312 for correct pricing. The CES  deal term date  is 12/1/98 to 12/1/2001 and gms # is s-roanoke-2746. I extended the Enron deal ticket to match the CES deal term. Not sure what  the pricing should be.  Thanks.
