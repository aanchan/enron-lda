Same thing on k#65403 And k#65534 - I left this one in red. Chris Germany Is contract 62164 a valid contract on CGAS?  It was highlighted in red in the  2000ces02.xls sheet.  I updated the info based on what I see in Navigator and  highlighted it in yellow.  And, if this is a valid deal, we need to add it to  Sitara.
