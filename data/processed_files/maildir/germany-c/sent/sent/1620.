Marianne Stiles Here are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.   Please do not forget that January 1 and January 2 will be lower because of the weekend/holiday.    I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not have that for all of the Algonquin markets until Monday, 12/27.      We will need a range from 3200 dth to 4200 dth per day.   This large swing is normal for these types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.  - agt012000.xls
