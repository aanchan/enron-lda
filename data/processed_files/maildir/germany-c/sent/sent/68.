Dick has this in at a $6.89, I assume you are ok with saving $2,250 on the  $.005. didn't think there was a problem. Were not my numbers OK? Did Tim and Dick ever chat about the FOM stuff?? What numbers should I be using now, FOM number, Volume sold back at Index  Flat? I bought 15,000/d at the TCO Pool from Dick J at $6.895 for 12/2 through  12/31. At first he was concerned we were swinging on ENA and not storage and  my nom. I have even included my estimate on the bottom of my daily nom sheet.
