KIM NOVSEK BIZIK Hi. For the month of January 2000, UGI will pull from the ELA Tabs #600494 and deliver to UGI's citygate for CES' endusers.  The daily volumes I have listed below are delivered volumes. January 1 - January 6 = 1214 dth per day January 7 - January 31 = 1489 dth per day It is not definite that the increase will occur on January 7th or the volume  of the increase.  That is an estimate.  Bayer will give us a better idea at the beginning of January. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you.
