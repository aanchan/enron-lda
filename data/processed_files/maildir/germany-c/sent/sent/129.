I think this is correct.  We will show it this way for now.  Can you verify  what were billed in demand for Oct please.  No rush., Brenda H Fletcher Deal # 118000 - Your comments on the terms tabs was this was 1 year deal  which would end 9/30/2000. I noticed that Jesse extended the date range to 2001.  Is this correct? BF
