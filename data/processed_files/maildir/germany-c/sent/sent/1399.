My mistake - we are talking about the 2nd.   Brian, do we need to do anything for the 1st?     	 	 	 only for 2/2.  for it to flow for 2/1 i would need anr/paulding.  Let me  know!!!! Opps - for gas flow day 2/1/2000.   Chris Germany Per my discussion with Joann, it looks like we have covered this 240 dth at  meter 80-03 on CGAS.
