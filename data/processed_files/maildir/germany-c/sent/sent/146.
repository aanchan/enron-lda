I can't remember, should the VNG demand charges be on I'm VNG or East and  Market East? Carol Herman said the mdq is 10,000 and the rate is $4.9473.   Chris please look at the deal in sitara, I copied the October deal that had a  reservation volume of 360,000. Scott Scott Goodell I entered the VNG Cove Point contract FPS1001 in sitara.  The deals are as follows: 484681  IM VNG 484687 Im Market East 484689 Im East I have a call into Transco's Carol Herman to get the correct rate.
