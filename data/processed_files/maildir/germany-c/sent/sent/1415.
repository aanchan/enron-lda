Sherry is waiting to make the payment - you guys tell me how to set this up  (CES - Cove Point or Cove Point)????     	 	 	 Linda and Sylvia....this is the counterparty that we spoke about yesterday  that we have not yet received the signed consent form on so that all trades  done prior to January (settled in January) need to settle through the CES -  Cove Point......any additional info you have on this?   Are the 3 storage  contracts new in 2000 and would be as Cove Point....where as December trades  settle as CES - Cove Point when the consent has not been received....your  thoughts?...mgg Chris Germany I understand we have the CES Cove Point  storage contracts set up as CES-Cove  Point in global.  What is the status of the paperwork and who is following up  on it.  Whent I look on Cove Point's website, I show that Enron North America  now has 3 storage contracts. Brenda H Fletcher Per Sherry, Global Counterparty is recognizing CES - Cove Point as the  counterparty  instead of Cove Point for the January payment.   The reason is lack of the appropriate paperwork executed by the  counterparty.   Brenda
