Russ Severson A friendly reminder. You were going to give us a list to let us know which transport capacity  tickets would have to be set up on which business units Also, you were interested in the ability to create multiple transport  capacity tickets when you get a new contract.  In the short term, could the generation of the additional tickets be created on a nightly  basis?     Russ.
