I think we are good to go.     	 	 	 We have WV produced TCo.  To my knowledge we have no Mountaineer.  CES never  wanted to buy Mountaineer production because of the daily balancing for both  the production and the end-user side. John Do we currently have any Mountaineer or West Virginia production?     	 	 	 I have no contacts to buy from.  Mountaineer production is normally sold on  term deals. CES needs 17dts/day of Mountaineer gas for the rest of March.  The request  was made by Kim Novesak?? I will be out this afternoon.  Please call Brian Perrone (703-561-6486) or  Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711. Thanks
