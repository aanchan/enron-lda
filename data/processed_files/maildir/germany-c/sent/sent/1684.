No chic - business trip.  May not go because tickets are $900.  I waited  toooooooo late doggoneit. Which chick are you taking with you??? cc: Why doesn't Enron promote from within.... same old story. It just took a long time before EOL had the markets out there. I leave Tuesday evening. There is a dinner Monday night... you should get an invite... since Goodell has to do the family thing... as always. What happen to Dick?? cc: Vickey told me yesterday was her last day. I see Scott Neal is on Tenn Z0. There are no quotes out there... just for Enron's info. I'll be in town this weekend.. going to TCO/Gulf meeting Monday and Tuesday. Hope to see you. Hope your back and other aches are okay.
