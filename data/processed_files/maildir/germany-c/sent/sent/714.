Good job.  Now what price should we bill EES. Elizabeth L Hernandez Deal 225818 is a deal that was copied from deal 113293 and looks like we have  been invoice EES at NX1 + .235 since 10/99.  If you have any other questions  please get with me. Chris Germany ENA is selling EES gas on CGAS.  Sitara deal #225818.  EES is showing a price  of $3.347 for May production and we are billing them $3.324, which price is  correct? Thanks
