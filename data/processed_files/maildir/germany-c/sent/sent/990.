Hey guys.  I'm cleaning up my emails and I don't know if this was ever  addressed. Comments? Doug Kinney would be the first person to start with. My sources tell me this means NIMO will continue to assign CES CNG capacity  unless CES can prove they have primary firm to NIMO.  What I'm not sure of is  will NIMO start assigning CES the upstream Tetco capacity. Scott, who at CES worked with NIMO on the capacity elections? Molly LaFuze Does this affect us?  If so, how?  Thanks Chris. Hi Molly, I don't know if this will effect Enron or not - I don't even know if Columbia Energy had any firm capacity off of CNG released through NIMO, but just in case, I though you might like to know about this. Sorry I am not much of a help here. Thanks! March 10, 2000 SENT VIA FAX, E-MAIL & WEBSITE NOTICE TO ALL MARKETERS PARTICIPATING IN BALANCED AGGREGATION: In accordance with P.S.C. No. 218 Gas Tariff, Leaf No. 184.2, Niagara Mohawk will continue to assign CNG capacity unless a final determination in the gas rate case precludes Niagara Mohawk from such assignment. If you filed an Affidavit of Firm Transportation Capacity with Niagara Mohawk last fall and the contract number for the capacity is still valid, Niagara Mohawk will continue to honor that contract and will not release CNG capacity  to you.  However, if the contract has expired, you must either re-submit an Affidavit with a valid contract number or Niagara Mohawk will assign CNG capacity to you.   The Affidavits are due Niagara Mohawk by the 25th of March, 2000.  Capacity will be assigned the week of March 20th for the month of  April. If you have any questions, please call Dennis Bartlett at 315-460-4042 or me  at 315-460-4041.  Thank you.
