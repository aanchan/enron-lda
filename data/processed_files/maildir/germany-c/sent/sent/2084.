That makes sense.  So you really are not using any ENA space but then I need  to check the overrun charges on the invoice.  If its ok with you, I think  I'll just wait to review the invoice before I do anything with that. I know we overan SST in COH.  Our nom was lower, but the retro increased.  Alvin & Joanne were checking TCO. We are hoping they don't cut us and don't  want to tip them that they could.
