Gloria G Barkowsky Brenda - All that is coming through to settlements on this is a demand  charge.  I have actualized receipts and deliveries, and in "offered services" it says billing basis is  on delivery, which it should be, except on mcf's not dth's, but it's still not coming through to settlements.   What do I need to do?   Let  me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118
