Marianne Stiles Here are the January daily volumes for each of the gates.    I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not have that for all Tennessee Zn 6  markets until Thursday as Boston Gas and S. Ct. Algorithms will be available then.   I have estimates in on those gates.  We will need a range from 2700 dth to 3600 dth per day.   This large swing is normal for these types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.
