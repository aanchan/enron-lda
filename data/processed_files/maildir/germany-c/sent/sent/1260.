Angie, this is not anything to worry about right now.  When you estimate your  flowing volumes for May, you need to decrease the total volume at Hastings by  3000 dth.  I will try to remind you.   HASTINGS BY 3,000 FOR MAY" These meters were all at Hastings agg point. Can you tell me which pools this impacts and how much by pool (hastings,  Bridgeport ...) FYI.  I received a letter today from Ed Arnold with Kriscott Inc. stating  that they will be terminating their CNG gas contract effective 5/1/2000.  For  volume purposes, his four meters produced about 3,000 dths a month.  Let me  know if anyone wants a copy of the letter. Thanks, HG
