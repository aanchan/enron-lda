This is proof that we at least get reimbursement from ECT - Canada on the  Boston Gas Transport.  I feel much better about this part. Thanks Brenda. Brenda H Fletcher FYI - THis is information I received on reimbursement from Enron Canada. Laura E Scott Reimbursement includes both. Brenda H Fletcher The reimbursement includes both Demand and Commodity. Please confirm.   Laura E Scott We reimburse 89.27% of the total Tennessee and Iroquois charges unless  Houston diverts to a more expensive place.  In that case we only reimburse  per the maximum to Boston. Brenda H Fletcher The transportation invoice from Tennessee Gas Pipeline for service contract  number 29667 for February 2000 production included $379,400 in Demand Charges and $5,998.36 in Commodity Charges.  Please let me  know what portion and percentage of charges are reimbursed by Enron Canada. Thanks, Brenda
