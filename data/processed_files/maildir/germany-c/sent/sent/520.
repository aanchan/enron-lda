Hey Doug, I'm back in the office for awhile.  Let me know if you still have  questions. Chris--In addition to my question regarding the AGL-related "transportation adjustment" charges in the June 15, 2000 invoice for May 2000 (invoice # 11738SA), can you also please check on the 200,000 dth sold to CES at the TENN Bear Creek storage facility in June?   (SA-236411).   Is this gas related to for, because we have not requested that any gas be injected into the Tennessee storage for this injection season. Thanks.
