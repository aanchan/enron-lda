    	Enron Capital Management 	 	 We can now calc at home/on the laptops.  After you dial in,( connect to  remoteservices.enron.com and log in), select start/programs/trading/xterm off  of the menu.  Xterm will bring up a window ... type in runm.  After that it  is calcing as normal.  From what I can tell it works okay.  Let me know if  you have any problems. Dave
