I told Dawn already, but my brother is getting married on the 16th.  We can't  make it. DG     	 	 	                            	 Hey - we have not done this in a long, long time.  Dawn and Gary want to host  a party at their house on Sept. 16th.  Who is interested?  let us know asap so that we can find subs if needed! thanks Sheri
