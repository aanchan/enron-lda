    	 	 	 Arnold, can you please have these flat screens moved 11/02 morning.  I will  mark them as complete on the next available churn.  Thank you.     	 	 	 Attached is the original churn that was submitted, the night that this was  supposed to happen your people were not able to switch the monitors out due to Bid - Week which is the  busiest time of the month and my  person was still working.  The person who came to move the monitors said that  they would come back on Monday or Tuesday and here it is Wednesday and nothing has been done.  If you  could update me with some type of information as far as when this will be taken care of that would be  greatly appreciated. Thanks, Elizabeth
