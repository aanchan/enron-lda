Thanks.  You can tell Phillip I'll have it fixed when I return on Monday. DG Darron:  Phillip called about the reconciliation, Jason told him that you  took it with you.  Just wanted to let you know Phillip was thinking about  you.  (Ha !) Thanks for your help yesterday.  All in all a smooth day.  Have  a great weekend. Anne
