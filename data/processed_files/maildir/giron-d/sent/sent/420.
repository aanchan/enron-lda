Pull this together and then call Sharon so they can come get the copies.   Thanks. DG In review of our third quarter file, we have not received the P&L top pages  or curve shift reports for the following regions:  West Firm, FT Northwest  and Mgmt. West.  Please provide this information as we would like to close  out our third quarter file.  Thank you in addition for your help. Sharon
