Please read. DG     	 	 	 We have new book names in TAGG for our intramonth portfolios and it is  extremely important that any deal booked to the East is communicated quickly  to someone on my team.  I know it will take some time for the new names to  sink in and I do not want us to miss any positions or P&L.   Thanks for your help on this.
