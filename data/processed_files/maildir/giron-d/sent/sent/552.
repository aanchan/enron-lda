I thought you might like this.  Do you have a ticket to Chicago yet?  I don't  think Jenny will have any luck getting hired in Risk.  We pretty much rule  anyone out without prior experience unless they are internal candidates.   However, I have forwarded her resume to Settlements and Volume Management.  I  think she should get a call from them.  How's life in Dallas?  Also, what is  your new cell number.  The Houston Cellular number no longer works.

M  Counting Sheep Mime-Version: 1.0 boundary="=====================_942762==_.ALT" ????????A shepherd was herding his flocks in a remote pasture when  suddenly a brand new Jeep Cherokee advanced out of a dust cloud towards him.  The  driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, Ray Ban sunglasses and a  YSL  tie leaned out of the window and asked our shepherd: "If I can tell you  exactly how many sheep you have in your flock, will you give me one?"  The shepherd looks at the yuppie, then at his peacefully grazing flock and  calmly answers "sure!"  The yuppie parks the car, whips out his notebook,  connects it to a cell-phone, surfs to a NASA page on the Internet where he  calls  up a GPS satellite navigation system, scans the area, opens up a database and  some 60 Excel spreadsheets with complex formulas. Finally he prints out a 150  page report on his hi-tech miniaturized printer, turns round to our shepherd  and  says: "You have here exactly 1,586 sheep!"  "This is correct. As agreed, you can take one of the sheep" says the  shepherd. He watches the young man make a selection and bundle it in his  Cherokee.  Then he says: "If I can tell you exactly what your business is,  will you give me my sheep back?"  "Okay, why not" answers the young man. "You are a consultant" says the  shepherd.  "This is correct" says the yuppie, "How did you guess that?"  "Easy" answers the shepherd. "You turn up here although nobody called  you. You want to be paid for the answer to a question I already knew the  solution to. And you don't know shit about my business--? you took my dog."  *"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*" *"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"*"* Eric Watson?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"I  came into this world  ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS CALIBRATION FACILITY????????????????? ????with nothing  and I?
