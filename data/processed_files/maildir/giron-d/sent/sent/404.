I forwarded your request to Luchas Johnson.  He runs the G-Daily-Est book. DG    3-9573     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Stacey Vallejo Hi again Darron Here are some more deals that need to be flipped out of the G-DAILY-EST book, QC3611.1 QC4110.1 QC4394.1 QC4496.1 QC4506.1 Can you please also go through this book to see if there are any more deals  between ECC and another counterparty.  These need to be fixed right away this  morning as I need to invoice and settle them today.  Please call me if you  aren't the person who handles this book, and please forward this message on  to the person who does. Thanks for your help Stacey
