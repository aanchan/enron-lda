Please send me the Meta ID.  I don't remember it.  I want to make sure we  have covered all of the counterparties.  Thanks. DG     	 	 	 Thanks for the list of existing transactions.  Only one question, it looks  like the list includes only the different corporate entities of NICOR.  Does  that mean that there were no existing transactions with the other Corporate  families, i.e. NIPSCO, CILCO, PGL and NS? Thanks, Gregg     	 	 	 Gregg, Attached is a list (forwards detail by risk type) disclosing all the deals  that Darron could come up with given your parameters. Glad the risk management group could be of some assistance. KR     	Enron North America Corp.
