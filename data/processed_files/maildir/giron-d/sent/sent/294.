Please read. DG Jeffrey C Gossett We have had a few recent instances where deals have been unwound in TAGG and  not in Sitara.  This, has,  in all cases resulted in a negative financial  impact.  Going forward,  no long-term physical deals will be unwound without  my signature,  and that of the physical trader responsible for trading the  area for which the deal was done.  Also,  all unwind tickets will require   the old TAGG and Sitara deal number to be written on the ticket.
