The Marine on duty tells the guy   that Clinton isn't President, and to please leave.   The man goes away.    The next day he comes back to the White House and   asks to see President Clinton. The marine on duty   reminds him that Clinton is not President, and to   please go away.  The man goes away.     The next day, he comes back again, and again the   same   Marine is on duty. The man asks to see President   Clinton, and the Marine, his patience worn out, says,   "WHY DO YOU KEEP COMING HERE ASKING FOR HIM?  CLINTON   IS NOT PRESIDENT ANYMORE!!!"  The man smiles and says,   "I know, I just like hearing it."         =====   E.J. Eiteljorge   US Army Hospital, Heidelberg   CMR 442 Box 990   APO AE 09042      Do You Yahoo!?
