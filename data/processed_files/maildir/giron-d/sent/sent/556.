You can start asking me about the West desk.  We don't have any new books for  this month. DG    3-9573 Jeffrey C Gossett Does anybody have any new book codes?  Also, if anyone knows who Kyle Etter's  replacement is, please let me know.  Thanks.    Kyle Etter, East Kam Keiser, Central Jeff Gossett, West David Baumbach, Texas WK Rebecca Ford During the August settlement period, we discovered at least 4 book codes that  had just recently started containing financial, third-party deals in them.   We tried to put a procedure into place where we were calling the risk guys to  find out about new books.  I don't know, however, if we are calling the right  people because we were not told about the 4 books that we discovered on our  own.   From now on, I am going to have Beatrice Reyna from my group call someone  from Reporting (Frank) and key people in Risk before we run our NYMEX  invoices at the end of the month.  Will, can you please send me a list of  people that Bea should contact that would know what we are talking about?   Even if the book codes are not brand new, but if they have just started  putting financial deals in them, WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THEM.   Thanks you so much for your help, Becky
