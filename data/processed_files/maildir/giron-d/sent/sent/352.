Phillip M Love Food for thought. PL ? For years,  the admiralty and maritime scholars have reviewed every    ?? statistic regarding the late great ship.? The simple facts  were that    the   ?? ship sailed with 2,224  men, women and children aboard.? Of that    number,    ?? 1,503 perished while only 711 survived.       ?? One of the last great mysteries was the previously unexplained  fact    that,   ?? of the 711 survivors, 704  were registered Republicans.      ?? It has been  only a theory for years, but recent events in Florida    confirm    ?? earlier suspicions:? all Republicans aboard the  Titanic were able to   ?? follow the arrows to the life  rafts.
