Steve Richman Darin, this is a summary of the Park and Loan deals that you should have. I  will need to talk to you regarding the Exchange deals that are included on  the summary of expected revenues. The only exchange that should be recorded  under enovate should be the enron exchange for $5,000. In that exchange PGL  Hub received molecules in June and returned them in July, ratable. Other than  that, if you have any questions call me at 312-541-1233. Thanks-Steve Richman
