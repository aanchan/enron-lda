Jeffrey C Gossett Stacey Vallejo Hi Jeff, Could you please do me a favor, and make sure that all Canadian deals that are in Houston books are flipped to the P& book.  I don't have a current  list of all the desk leads, so I thought that I'd ask you to forward this message on to them for me.  I know that the EOL group is still working on a solution to our problem, but there are still deals that are in Houston books that need to be flipped. Please let me know if there is anything I can help with.  Thanks for your help on this. Stacey
