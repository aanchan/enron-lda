Please read DG Jeffrey C Gossett Please make sure that all physical deals with a finacial component are marked  physical in TAGG.  Mostly this applies to annuities associated with physical  deals and imbedded options.   Not clicking physical is causing problems with  accounting as well as the credit group. Thanks
