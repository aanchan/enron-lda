Gabriel Monroy Darron, you recognized 3.975 (thousand) of orig, and I did not see that  coming out of any book. Could you let me know who granted that.  I know  0.5  (thousand) were granted by the NG Price, but I could not fine  anything else. Also, if you could please look into the 468 (dollars) that I  mentioned on my previous email, I would appreciate it.  Thanks.  If you have any questions let me know.  Gabriel
