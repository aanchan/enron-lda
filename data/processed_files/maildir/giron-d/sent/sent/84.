We granted a total of $320K ($220K to you and $100K to credit reserve) by  mistake.  We will take the extra $100K in orig from you tonight.  I  appologize for the error. DG Barry Tycholiz advised me that you granted $220,00 to me.  $100,000 needs to  go to credit to cover exposure per memo below. Please advise if I am mistaken. thanks!
