Jennifer, Phillip Allen and Keith Holst indicated that the curve changes in question  for Socal was simply due to a higher forward market.  Let me know if you have  any further questions. DG Jeffrey C Gossett Please get responses for these back to Jennifer today. Thanks     	 	 	 Jeff -- Before I send out the memo for January, I have a few questions about 3 curves  that were reviewed this month.  Attached are Powerpoint slides containg the  10 curves that were validated for January.  The ones I'm asking you to take a  look at are: 1)  NGI-SOCAL -- Why the upshift for the entire curve compared to prior  month?  Why has the shape of the curve changed from (approximately) 1/1/04  forward compared to the curve from prior month? 2)  IF-MONCHY -- What factors account for differences between the 1/31/01  curve vs. the 12/29/00 curve for the period between 1/1/01through 1/1/07? 3)  IF-TRANSCO Z3 --  What factors account for the entire curve changing so  dramatically from last month to this month? Thanks for your help. Jennifer
