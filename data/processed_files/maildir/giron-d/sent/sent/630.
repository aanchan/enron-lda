	Kevin W Drachenberg 	 7-31-00 Trying to wrap up as much as I can before my last day on Friday.  Have you  had a chance to look into this? Kevin 	Kevin W Drachenberg 	 7-31-00 This is the detail for the invoice I mentioned in my voice mail to you.  I  need to get the Sitara number if this has been set up so I can pay Peoples. Thanks, Kevin x3-0560 	Kevin W Drachenberg 	 7-31-00 Kevin, Doing some more month end clean up.   I received an invoice from Peoples Gas to ENA for $5,000.  The description is: For Summer-Winter Exchange Agreement between Peoples and ENA from June 1,2000  through July 31,200 for 1Bcf. 1 Bcf Program Original Hedge:  1,000,000 MMBtu x .005 = $5,000 I cannot find a Sitara deal for this amount.  Will you please look into  this?  They told me the deal maker is Richard Tomaski. If you send me your fax number I'll send you a copy of the invoice. Thanks, Kevin
