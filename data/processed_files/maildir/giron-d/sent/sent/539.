Jeffrey C Gossett Stacey Vallejo Just a quick request for you to go into all your books to make sure that  there are no ECC deals booked there.  If there are any that are with  counterparties other than RISKMANTRA, they need to be flipped to the  FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.  Invoicing for November should  start today, and both ECC and ENA are held back from invoicing until these  deals are fixed, as the deals will be invoiced by the wrong Enron  counterparty if they aren't.  If you could please let me know when the deals  have been fixed, I can let the accounting department in Houston know when  they can start invoicing as well. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this matter. Thank you Stacey
