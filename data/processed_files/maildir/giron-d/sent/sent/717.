Done DG 	Kevin W Drachenberg 	 Have you had a chance to look at this adjustment to $.1134?  Sitara still  shows .0556.  I'd like to include this adjustment on the 7/00 invoice I'm sending out  tomorrow. Please let me know when updated. Thanks, Kevin x3-0560 Audrey Cook After reviewing the pipeline calculations, the pipeline commodity  reimbursement should be the following: Commodity $.0594 Fuel  $.054 (Assuming GD Tenn/500 = $2.775 (Mar 15), and Tennessee Fuel % =  1.91%) Total  $.1134 The commodity was adjusted to recover the Tennessee pipeline commodity costs  not Midwestern pipeline commodity ($.0594 vs. $.0016).  Let Kevin or myself  know if you have any questions.   Please let us know when this has been  completed.  Thanks. ajc Audrey Cook Darron, Please update Sitara #127427 for the fuel for 3/15/2000: Commodity $.0016 Fuel  $.054 (Assuming GD Tenn/500 = $2.775 (Mar 15), and Tennessee Fuel % =  1.91%) Total  $.0556 Please let me know when this has been completed so I can redraft.
