It should reference the EOL number.  It looks af if Kevin did not link it  up.  I'll remind him. DG Dawn C Kenne Darron, When you are manually entering the EMW deals into tagg, are you referencing  the EOL number?   I was looking at the tagg deal you gave me last Friday (Q40121) and it does  not reference it.  Should it?  Or, because it is funky, does it not have to? Dawn
