Please take care of this if you have any to be flipped.  Thanks. DG Stacey Vallejo This is just a quick reminder for all of you to please go into all of your  books and flip out all the deals that are supposed to settle with ECC and a  third counterparty  to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book by the end of the day today.   Nymex closes today, and we need to make sure that all the deals are booked  correctly for both the Calgary and Houston offices.  This is most important  for February and March 2001 deals. Please let me know if you have any questions on this. Thanks for all your help Stacey
