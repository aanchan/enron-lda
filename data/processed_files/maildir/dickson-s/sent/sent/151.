Where do we stand on this? 		  Dra ft) Hi Debra! As per our conversation, attached is Constellation Power's comments to the  Master Firm agreement they received from  Roy Rodriguez.  I will be happy if you can review this.  Additionally, as  soon as I come to some agreement with their credit group regarding threshold  and MACs, I will draft a credit worksheet and forward same to you. Thanks Rudwell.  Rudwell- Pursuant to our discussion, attached please find a revised draft of the Enfolio Agreement between CPS and enovate LLC.  The form of agreement is the original one used by Enron and edited accordingly for enovate LLC. The edits proposed (as submitted to enovate back in January) are consistent with industry standards and according to my notes were being forwarded to enovate's Legal (Enron) for further review.   We are continuing contact and discussions to this matter with Roy Rodriguez at enovate and hope we can put closure to this agreement in the very near future.
