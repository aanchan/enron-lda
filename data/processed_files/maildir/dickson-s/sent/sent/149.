Does this make sense to you? 		  Please reconfirm as necessary. These were all riding on contracts that have  been "assigned" to AEP/HPL/Lodisco effective 6/1/01. ENA is no longer party  to the original agreements. Please note that several of these are EOL  transactions. Thank you! Cyndie PS, Accounting was not copied on this message as there is no accounting  impact on the contract # changes (all deals moved have production beginning  6/1/01 (no additional production was finalized or cleared on these  transactions under the prior agreement).
