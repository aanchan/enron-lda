I am working on getting the Bowie contract.  Meanwhile, I spoke to the B & J  attorney.  He asked if Enron wanted to continue to buy the gas.  I told him  that his client should contact you directly so that you guys could discuss  price. Stacy 		  Bowie, Inc. left me this e-mail this morning.  He would like to have a copy  of his gas purchase agreement.  Per bowie, the contract number might be  96-022415. Thanks Jim Any luck..thanks..have a great Monday.
