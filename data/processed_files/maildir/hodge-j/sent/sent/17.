Janette: This is fine with me.  Can you go ahead and do what is necessary here. Thanks,  Jeff 	Sheri L Cromwell 		  Jeff, Genia is having problems with her laptop, and evidently it was never imaged  properly.  Our floor tech, Kien is going to reimage the machine, but we also  need to order an additional 128 megs of memory.   If this meets with your approval, please forward this message to Janette.   Thanks! (Janette, Genia is under GL #0413, CC #105657.)
