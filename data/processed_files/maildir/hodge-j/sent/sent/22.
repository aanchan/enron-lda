Michael: It is circulating.  I really do not have any idea as to time frame. Jeff 	Michael Slade 		  Hello Jeff - I'm not chasing at all, but wondered when the Unanimous Consent  might have been finalised - as you can see it won't delay the  recapitalization process but will be needed in due course for registration. I  promised I would let local counsel know a likely timeframe. Many thanks for your help. Michael Michael apparently the notary is not going to raise problems but he is not going to register the deed in his books until he receives the original of the proxy (the unanimous consent can be attached to it later although it will be mentioned in the deed). When do you think the courier will be here? Regards, Piero I will be out of the office from 08/12/2000 until 12/12/2000. I will respond to your message when I return.  If you require any urgent assistance, please contact Nicola Beales on 0207 783 7279.
