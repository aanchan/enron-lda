Jim: I agree.  However, it probably would make some sense to have EWS legal look  at any particularly complex pricing structures that may be passed by the EWS  desk. Jeff 		  We  have not discussed EWS involvement in Term Sheets.  I would think  contract review would be enough (do you really want mor things to review?),   but will defer to your judgement.  Jim 	Enron Energy Services 	 	Phone No: 713-853-6463 	 Would ENA need to review at the term sheet stage? 	Enron Energy Services 	 	Phone No: 713-853-6463 	 I am reviewing the below term sheet tonight and we are discussing internally  tomorrow at 8:00 am with a view to turning to customer by noon. I will review  the commodity portion to see if I have questions for you.  Do you want  someone in commodity to take a look as well?
