Richard: I received a delivery failure notice when I tried to forward this to you and  the Susman & Godfrey lawyers.  As I do not have their e-mail addresses  with me, could you forward this on to them if you think it is necessary. Thank, Jeff 	Jeffrey T Hodge 		 Brian: I had an opportunity to review your draft letter.  My thoughts are as follows:  1.  I am not sure that I would limit yourself to discussions on the price  alone.  I might make some reference to discussing potential commercial       resolutions to avoid the reopener.  2.  You make a reference in the letter to "GSA".  I do not think that is  defined anywhere else and probably needs to be. Other than that, I am fine with the letter.  I will leave it to Richard to  finalize this with you. Thanks, Jeff                	Brian Redmond 		 Richard: Please review/revise the attached and resend to Lillian Carrol and myself.  I  am in Boston (Tues) returning Wed, but Lillian can sign for me. Thanks, Brian
