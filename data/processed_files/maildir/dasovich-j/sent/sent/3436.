Eldon said that you were making dinner on Friday, the 9th, and that he was  flying a plane to pick up Cameron and Rory in Carmel.  Have you guys spoken  in the last few months!?!?!?  (kidding.)  And don't worry about my  birthday--that's not the issue.  It's Eldon's 80th--that's huge.  Friday is  the 9th.  So I'm just checking in to see what's up.  My very strong  inclination--for a variety of reasons, but Eldon's b-day is the biggest  one--is to cancel. Signed, confused 		  I'm not sure what Friday will bring - the party as you know (for you and  Eldon as far as I am concerned) is on Saturday - however, none of your  friends will be there except us!  When would you normally get back?

Coast Viticulture contact  Finally - here is the name of the contact  Nancy, sorry this took a while, but it will be worth it.  If anybody knows  about the Sonoma Coast, it's this guy.  He's done work with Flowers,  Kistler, etc. out there.  His name is Greg Bjornstad (sp.?) and his number  is (707) 829-1687.  He doesn't really know me from a hole in the ground but  you can "double reference" my name as Todd Graff's friend.  Todd is the  winemaker at Sonoma Creek and is a good friend of mine who worked with Eric  on some projects.
