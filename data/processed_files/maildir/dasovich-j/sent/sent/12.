Attached is the revised document.  I faxed the signature pages and service  list.  I also faxed the entire document.  We will mail the document to the  parties on the service list. Brigitte Attached are the final comments due today. Have them signed and fax me the signed page so that we can serve them to the commission, and  mail them to the service list. Thank You Bruno (See attached file: Enron Respone to Wood and Duque Final.doc)  - 50407.3.doc
