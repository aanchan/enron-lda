sorry, your mom kept the huckles.  The apples and apple pie sound great.  And you made with mom & dad. Everyone probably pitched in, right?  Sounds American as... That's scary about Annie- I guess she is OK now. I want the huckles - I would have made a sauce with them like I was going to do last time (but you guys forgot and made other plans with Tom & Karen).

C1 is doing a demo integration with us.  We are having a hard time getting a booth at their conference, but at least we will be able to announce a loose partnership with them. We meet with Ariba tomorrow. How was the dome?  San Diego was beautiful!
