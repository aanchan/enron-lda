Yes.  Thanks very much Maureen and Ginger.  There is a subsequent power point  presentation that I'm fairly confident I distributed (may have done so after  I got back from New York, so you might also want to search Steve and Rick's  in-boxes through the first two weeks of February).  Thanks again for the help. Best, Jeff 	Richard Shapiro 		  California Crisis Was'nt there an earlier powerpoint? Maureen McVicker California Crisis   HERE'S A DRAFT OF THE EXNET PRESENTATION.  I'LL KEEP LOOKING FOR THE FINAL  VERSION. California Crisis   I've still got considerable work to do, but wanted to make sure all had a  chance to review and comment well in advance of finalizing.  I'm giving a  talk at Exnet on Monday about California.  Attached is a draft of the  slides.  All comments welcome and appreciated.  I'm continuing to work on  it.  Thanks very much. Best, Jeff
