Here's the document that I referenced.  Dan Allegretti asked me to forward it  to you.  He'd like to distribute to the leadership team and have it on the  agenda during his part of the conference call.  Thanks a million. Best, Jeff 		  Much obliged; I promised in return to forward this legislative outline, and I look forward to your views.  - portfoliomgmtlegoutline.DOC
