math error.  big sleeps 8. little sleeps.   can you explain the panic about sleeping arrangements, and could you fill me  in on what those arrangements are prior to sending the email out? 		  I don't see how you get the numbers.  Can you please explain.  I don't have the time to do this right now and I have to get the email off to the people about sleeping arrangements.  I get 8 in one house and 5 in the other. Please answer ASAP.
