OK!!!  I don't put my stuffing in the bird!!!  The more cranberries the  better!!! Yours truly!!!! Jeff!!! p.s. how did pittsburg lose??!?!?!?!??!?!?!?? 		  If you would make an oyster stuffing - that would be really grand!  Not one  for inside the bird - but a separate one - does that work?  I'm doing the  cranberries tonight - but if yours is different from normal (!) we can always  have another! thanks                                                                                                                             for such a fun birthday dinner and such extravagant presents!  My word -  you guys sure went all out.  Best of course was having you all there.  I  love you!!  Nancy  (707) 251-4870 (phone)  (707) 265-5446 (fax)  "Plus je bois, mieux je chante"
