Greetings TJ: have obviously missed the times, it's my fault, and I apologize. I spoke with Diane this morning and she suggested that I throw myself at the  mercy of the court by writing you an email with my picks.  Here they are: Class     Control #   My Priority  Units Competitive Strategy   09441     1  3 Negotiations    09514     2  3 Non-Profit Boards   09787     3  1 Financial Institutions and Markets 09472     4  3 Leadership and Change  09520     5  3 I'd like to take 7 units (2, 3-unit classes and the 1-unit class). Sorry for the mix-up.  Thanks very much for you help.  If you have any  questions, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822. Best, Jeff
