Let me know so I can pass along to Marathon.  Thanks! kd Karen Rich spoke with Frank regarding focus group video and polling results. Frank said that he would be happy to release poll results if he gets approval from someone at Enron.  Can you facilitate this? Also, Frank said that he does not have a copy of the focus group video.  Can you obtain a copy for Rich? Thanks. Sandra
