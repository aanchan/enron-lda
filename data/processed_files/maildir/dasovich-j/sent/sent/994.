B.O. Sorry, I was out of the office all day.  Hope you got there. 		  Sorry, dude. Don't mean to overload you. But could you just tell me the best  way to get from Geary and Larkin to a Bart station that will take me to  Berkeley? Cameron and I are going to see Steve Earle's sister Stacey tonight  at the Frieght. I think she asked P dub-yah if you guys wanted to come, but  becaue there's no banjo and all that... When you get a chance to give me  that info, I'd greatly appreciate it. Best, Big Oil Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.
