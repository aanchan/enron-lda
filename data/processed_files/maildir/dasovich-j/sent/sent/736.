No sweat.  Not a problem.  Summary will do fine.  Let's definitely try to  coordinate for the next meeting.  You have a great weekend, too. Best, Jeff 	Lara Leibman 		 Jeff, Unfortunately, we have to keep the date as scheduled.  I am very sorry.   Hopefully, the next meeting will work better for your schedule and we will  have a better opportunity to give our preferences for dates.  This time  round, tax sort of took the lead.  Also, I promise to provide a summary  afterwards. Hope you have a great weekend. Lara 	Jeff Dasovich Good idea.  Unfortunately, I'll be sitting in an office in S.D. with Sempra  execs.  My apologies.  But since this is likely to be ongoing, preference  would be to participate in the "first" meeting. 	Lara Leibman 		 Jeff, Could you possibly call in? We could arrange for a dial-in number in that  case.  I know that we arranged that date with tax bc/Sue is coming in that  day and they had cleared that date with some of the accounting or legal folks  already.  Please let me know.  Thanks. Lara 	Jeff Dasovich Lara: I would very much like to attend but have a meeting scheduled that day with  Chris Calger (ENA) and the CEO and CFO of Sempra Energy (we're trying to do a  deal with them).   That's a date that I can't change.  I can meet on Nov.  3rd, or Nov. 7-9.  Hope it's possible to re-arrange Best, Jeff 	Lara Leibman 		  Jeff and Mike, Our first meeting has been scheduled to take place on November 2nd.  The  meeting will probably last half a day and will begin around 1pm.  Please let  me if you plan to attend.  Thanks and have a great weekend. Regards, Lara
