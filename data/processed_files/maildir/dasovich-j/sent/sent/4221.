You got it.  Just give me a call and we'll walk through "the other side of  the story." Best, Jeff 	Rob Bradley 		  Can I talk you or someone else who is close to this into a one pager on why   a simple supply/demand explanation of California border prices trumps  Carpenter's El Paso dun it conspiracy analysis? I don't want Lay to be stumped by a question on this at his Wednesday IAEE  talk. - Rob 		  Attached is Paul Carpenter (Brattle Group) preliminary findings that  marketers have market power at the border. By my second email I'm sending Enron's responses to the pleadings at FERC  which refute the notion of the need to reinstitute price controls at the  California border. Alternatively, a good argument to high gas prices at the CA border is the  message in Stan's natural gas roundtable speech (i.e. high gas prices can be  directly attributed to supply/demand factors). Per your request, attached are the presentation slides from yesterday. Douglas Porter, Senior Attorney Southern California Edison Company (626)302-3964 (626)302-3990(fax)  - DRT2486.PPT
