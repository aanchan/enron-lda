Greetings Mr. Newlywed and Ms Bride-to-be!  (Shewt, I'm gettin' all choked  up.) I think I'll need to protest TURN's proposal.  You folks aware of this?  Care? Best, Jeff 		  On 2/14, the Southern California Generator Coalition filed a petmod asking  that the Commission amend winter balancing rules to allow customers to bring  more gas into the system than the 10% imbalance rules permit and that  customers be allowed to use the previous month's accumulated positive  imbalance in lieu of flowing supplies.   The generator members of WPTF with facilities in southern California may be  interested in knowing that TURN's 3/15 comments recommend instead that the  Commission should rebundle the costs of storage for electric generators in  their transportation rates and requires SoCalGas to store gas on behalf of  those customers.   Let me know if you want to see the TURN comments.   Dan
