8 (big) 6 (little). i assume "trundle" sleeps two. 		  Damnit Jeff.  What is the sleeping situation in the second cabin.  I don't have time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The panic is my waste of time trying to get things organized.  That's the panic.  I also don't want to tell people there are beds for them if there are not.  Could you just right a simple straightforward email with the number of beds.  Was there a math error on that one also????

Can you please explain.  I don't have the time to do this right now and I have to get the email off to the people about sleeping arrangements.  I get 8 in one house and 5 in the other. Please answer ASAP.
