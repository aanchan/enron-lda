Attached is a letter that we worked on today and that will be sent to the  Governor, CA's US Senators (Boxer/Feinstein), congressional folks, and key  many of the things we've discussed over the past several months, so there  shouldn't be any surprises.  If you've got any concerns please give Paul a  call at home or page me at 888.916.7184. Jeff 		  Attached is a revised draft of the letter reflecting the comments recevied on  today's call.  I toned down references to the Secretary's action yesterday,  reduced the discussion of caps, and eliminated our response to the "when did  you stop beating your dog" question.
