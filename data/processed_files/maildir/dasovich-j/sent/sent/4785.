Here's the document that I sent, and the list of folks that I sent it to. 	Jeff Dasovich 	 Folks: Here is a rewrite of the power point presentation referenced in the previous  note.  Again, please keep confidential and do not distribute.  It's the copy  that Hertzberg used to present to his caucus.Thanks. Best, Jeff P.S.  Our numbers show that noncore for Edison would be about 30% of load;  Hertzberg has it at about 20%.
