What kind of contract? 		  Think the 6-8 months is baloney.  Can you verify? Bill Bill, Info...in recent talks SCE ventured the opinion that based on thier alleged experience it would take 6 or 8 months to get a new contract cycled thru the CPUC for approval and implementation.  If this is true (which I doubt) it could impact on the operational capability of our PDA which expires in 7 months.  Do you folks agree it could not happen quicker.  If need be, do you know any strategy for getting thru that process quicker? Paul
