well, don't seem to be an electronic copy out there.  trying to get a hard  copy. 	Susan Scott 		  The proceeding is I0011002; I think the order was issued Nov. 2. Susan Scott Jeff, I read in Gas Daily that the Cal PUC has issued an OII on the adequacy  of supply and pipeline infrastructure in southern California.  Could you have  someone send me a copy of the order whenever it is issued?  Steve thinks it's  something we might want to get involved in, but I need to know more.   Great to see you last week. Ciao, Susan
