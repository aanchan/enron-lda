		  Senator Dunn's investigative hearing tomorrow is going to feature two ex-Duke employees who claim to have taken several logs which demonstrate that Duke withheld power and did not perform appropriate maintenance. Senator Dunn is refusing to allow Duke to defend themselves at the hearing.  Duke may hold a press conference after the hearing.
