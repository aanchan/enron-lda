Hmmm. FYI.  Dear old Edison. 		  El Paso Natural Gas Company, et al., Docket No. RP00-241-000 FYI. Paso Natural Gas Company, et al., Docket No. RP00-241-000 Yes, It had by shipper, by contract level info.  -- the type of info available on  our transactional reports.  There is a protective order in place in the  proceeding, so I don't believe the information is generally available.  We  did not ask for confidential treatment -- but we did excise rate information  for periods prior to Sept. 2000 (the date that this info started appearing on  our transactional reports). Paso Natural Gas Company, et al., Docket No. RP00-241-000 FYI  Judge Wagner issued a subpoena to Transwestern and several other pipelines in  the referenced proceeding at SoCal Edison's request.  The request sought  information on scheduled, actual and contracts quantities to the California  border for the time period 1997 to present.  While we are not a party in the  case, we decided to cooperate in the proceeding and not file a motion to  quash.  We responded yesterday.
