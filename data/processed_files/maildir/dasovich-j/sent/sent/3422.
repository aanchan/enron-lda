Ken:  could you call me at 415.782.7822 re: Loretta's talk tomorrow (I'll be  in Sacramento).  Thanks, Jeff 	Please respond to "Ken Smith" 		  I will be unable to be on the conference call tomorrow... I'm at the Loretta Lynch lunch. I may try to call in on my cell for part of the conversation.  Is the number and code the same for each call? I'll report back on what she says in her appearance before the Press Club.
