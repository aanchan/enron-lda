Yes, am aware of it, but there was no attachment (re: PG&E's proposal) in the  note that I received.  Could someone please forward?  Thanks. 		  Jess,  what do know about this?  If you have any info let Jeff Nieland  know.    Jeff  N.,  I am not familiar with the Cal. EEP.  In most state it is not  unusual for transmission customer (usually all the  customers are involved)   to be part of the plans.  Jeff Dasovich or Roger Yang may have more details.  Gentlemen, Do we have any influence over this issue with our direct access customers in  California?  IBM San Jose is on an interruptible transmission tariff and is  concerned about the proposed Mandatory Curtailment Plan.  I would appreciate  any comments. Thanks Jeff Tom - Who would you recommend asking to comment from our regulatory  department? cc: Here is a soft copy of what I faxed you yesterday.

Organization: CMTA Importance: High Hi Dan and Tom, Greetings.  I hope all is well with both of you and PPG. I recently received information that transmission voltage customers will likely be required to be involved in the Electric Emergency Plan (EEP) in the future.  Currently transmission customers are not "required" to curtail any load when distribution circuits are taken off line as a result of a Stage 3 EEP operation. Please take a look at the attachment below and if possible provide comments to help shape the proposed change.  I will need comments by this Friday noon if possible.  Thanks for the input.
