Mona and I plan to be in Sacramento tomorrow at an AB 1890 Implementation  Group meeting.  I think that Sue also has a conflict.  My thought was to have  someone from the PR firm that Karen has brought on go and report back.  I'm  supposed to give a presentation on gas tomorrow, but it's not a problem for  me to cancel and go to S.D. if we think that it's vital for one of us to be  there in person.   Thoughts? Best, Jeff 	James D Steffes 		  Is anyone going? Jim 		  FYI     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
