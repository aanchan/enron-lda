As you know, I have great interest.  However, I've checked flight schedules  to come out Tuesday night, and to put it mildly, it's very ugly.  Seems like  and take place anyway.  Is there any chance that Lisa could get a phone in  your meeting room so that I could participate by conference call?  Sorry for  Best, Jeff By this e-mail I'm requesting that we all meet on Wednesday, September 13,  2000, for breakfast to discuss the California/FERC wholesale issues that have  been plaguing us and will plague us over the next year or so.   I suggest  forums we are facing; and (2) our allocation of resources to the inventory.   If time permits, we can also have a substantive discussion of the issues.  In  this regard, if its ready, we can present an overview of the California  strategy that is being developed (initially) by Sandi and Jeff.    Respond ASAP directly to Lysa Akin with your interest in participating in  this meeting. Lysa:  once we have a head count, please get us a meeting room and  breakfast.  We'll need an easel with paper and markers.
