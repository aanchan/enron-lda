Sounds good.  See you at 11. Best, Jeff 		  Sounds good.   I have reserved Mt. Bachelor conf room for 11:00 tomorrow. Also, I am forwarding the invite to Alan Comnes, Jonalan Page ,Angela Cadena  and Andrea Woodland.  They were a part of the discussion with Dave. I can be available most of the day except 2:00-3:00.  Let me know if you have  a set meeting schedule. Hi Mike: Parquet found me to talk about the QF ideas that you guys are bouncing  around.  I'll be in Portland tomorrow.  You have some time to sit and discuss  a bit? Best, Jeff
