Quick add on to Sue's note: Right now, appears they're focused on the budget, but could take up energy.   many Democratic Assembly members don't know at this point what the plan is  for this afternoon/evening. Our lobbyists are attempting to get more info,  which we'll pass on soon as we get it. Best, Jeff 	Susan J Mara 		  Our lobbyist called to let us know. Sue Mara Enron Corp.
