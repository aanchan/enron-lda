don't get in till 8:45.  that work? best, jeff 		  Bingo!  Thank you!  Does 8:30 a.m. your time Wednesday work for a call? I can't open it.  Didn't you tell me last week there was some trick to  getting these documents open? Meeting will be on Wednesday.  Still compiling everyone's schedule -- did you  know Steve was on vacation this week? we have  time yet for tomorrow's meeting re: contempt stuff?
