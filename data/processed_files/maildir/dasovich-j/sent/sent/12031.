Thanks.  Call me on my cell, or page me after you meeting this afternoon and  let's discuss. Best, Jeff 		  They are being contacted and should oppose if they think about it twice. Mike cc: Alert                She is there in her capacity as WGSI until you agree with me that Enron should oppose this bill.  Hint, hint.  Have you heard from Harry or Jim S. or Parquet?  Mike Alert Jeff; In response to your questions, I cannot explain why everyone missed this bill in the past, I have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in the last two months.  However, now that it is moving they have got the message.  Williams (Kern River) is going to host a meeting today to create a coalition to oppose the bill.  Bev Hansen knows where the meeting will take place.  In addition to Williams, I understand that Questar, WSPA, and other retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill.  My client Wild Goose will also be listed in opposition, but they don't carry that much clout or name recognition so far.  I am hopeful that other groups will surface soon. As for the bill itself, the problem is two fold.  First, the CPUC decides what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities.  They take input from customers, but Loretta is a command and control type all the way, and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold-plated state-regulated system.  While the bill does not (and cannot legally) bar interstate pipelines from coming into the state, it has provisions which will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates.  The large customers have to commit to take firm service on a 5 year basis with exit fees.  If they don't take this, they can only get interruptible service from the utilities.  Many if not all large customers, especially generators cannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only interruptible access to the LDC system.  This is the same dilemma that the RLS tariff caused.  My belief is that the obligation on the part of the commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another attempt to reinstitute the RLS tariff or an onerous peaking rate.  The Commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not undertaken the firm 5 year commitment and will therefore be unable to economically take partial requirements service from an interstate.  My view is based on Sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision and statements by Lynch's office.  This could interfere with Enron gas sales over the interstates, and would certainly threaten any Transwestern plans for building across the border into California, although that does not appear to be a high priority at this time.  This bill will also make it more costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of their needs. Please call if you have further questions.  Mike Day Alert Harry -- Can you track down this bill and determine impact?  We'll discuss on Thursday. Jim cc: Is AB 23XX moving with a chance of passage?   I just learned that this Pescetti bill that was AB 1425 was revived as a 2X bill.  It is very anti-competitive, and could hurt a number of TW, EES, or ENA gas deals by binding customers to 100% utility service through the imposition of large exit fees by the CPUC.  If there is a chance that it moves, we need to discuss the effect of this bill.  Mike Day http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/bill/asm/ab_0001-0050/abx2_23_bill_20010625_amend ed_sen.pdf
