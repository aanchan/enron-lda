I agree with Harry.  In particular, we'll need to make Richard Sanders and  ENA's outside counsel are aware.  I have been concerned, and continued to be  concerned about, the implications of being in the case, understanding that  our interests--and the stakes--are very high.  Continues to seem important  that we be in, but we'll need to discuss further, and make sure that Jim and  ENA's attorney's are in the loop. Best, Jeff 	Harry Kingerski 		  I think what Bob is trying to tell us, with this and another message I will  send you shortly, is that we can expect similar questions if we dip our toes  into the waters of this PUC case.   Jeff - this tells me we need ENA awareness/agreement ? with our going forward  in the CPUC case.
