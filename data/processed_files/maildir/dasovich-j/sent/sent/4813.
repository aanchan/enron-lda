i'm very willing, but if it has to be done this week, it ain't going to  jobs?  if so, congratulations.  nice title.   best, Jeff 	Please respond to josepht 		  Hello Comrades: Round two of the admission process is onto the acceptance stage and Diane has called upon us again to rally round the phones and corral these new admits.  We have about 85, so with 7 of us, that translates to about 12 contacts apiece. Please confirm your willingness and availibility so I can send out the lists ASAP.  TJ tells me that they want these calls made this week. Thanks, again  (and you thought you were enjoying your summer--except for the Enron manager, of course)  ;-] JT ===== Joseph Tambornino Vice President  Hall Equities Group (925) 933-4000 Do You Yahoo!?
