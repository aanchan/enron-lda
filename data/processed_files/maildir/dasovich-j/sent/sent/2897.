The playboy mansion? 		  I think that is a great idea.  It would be great.  Fun mix of people too. Where should we have it???  I think it should not be at our house in Napa, but someplace a little more special.

Nothing wrong with being comfortable in your birthday suit. Speaking of birthdays, I think we should have a goal to get my company acquired by your company by May 30, 2001.  Good goal, huh?? I want to talk to you about the details I have been thinking about while you were gone.  When should we talk??  Let's set up a meeting so we make sure to move this all forward. Welcome back. -C Cameron Sellers Vice President, Business Development PERFECT 1860 Embarcadero Road - Suite 210 Palo Alto, CA 94303 650.798.3366 (direct dial) 650.269.3366 (cell) 650.858.1095 (fax)
