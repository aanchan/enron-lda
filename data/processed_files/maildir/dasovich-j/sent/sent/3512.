FYI. 		  Julie: I see that ABX1-8 (Migden) is set for hearing tomorrow morning in Assem. Appropriations. Does IEP have proposed language yet?  Attached is the amended version of SB 28x (Sher/Battin) which contains  several changes to the siting process, including many sponsored by IEP. The  bill is being heard in the Senate Energy Committee today.  Julee Malinowski-Ball  Senior Associate  Edson + Modisette  916-552-7070  FAX-552-7075
