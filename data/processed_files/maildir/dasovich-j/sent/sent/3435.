har-dee-har-har.  I mean, will we be celebrating in some fashion.  I'm  scheduled to go to Houston--I'm not kidding--but if there's something  planned, which I assume there is, then I'm going to cancel my trip to  Houston, like pronto. Ironically, Jeff 		  cooking!  Coast Viticulture contact                                                                                                                                                                                                                Finally - here is the name of the contact  Nancy, sorry this took a while, but it will be worth it.  If anybody knows  about the Sonoma Coast, it's this guy.  He's done work with Flowers,  Kistler, etc. out there.  His name is Greg Bjornstad (sp.?) and his number  is (707) 829-1687.  He doesn't really know me from a hole in the ground but  you can "double reference" my name as Todd Graff's friend.  Todd is the  winemaker at Sonoma Creek and is a good friend of mine who worked with Eric  on some projects.
