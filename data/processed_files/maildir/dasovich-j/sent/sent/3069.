		  Hi Team, I did not get much time to work on the case today - got  pulled into a few meetings, and only just got back form  class. BUT, tomorrow looks good...  Jeff, Mark: can you send across what you have? Should  we shoot for a conf call around 12:00?  For Class 5 (i.e. second half tomorrow), didn't Sarah say  she was going to send across a pdf file on email, or put  something on Izio web site ? Did anyone receive this file? -Anil  cc: Financial                                               Information Analysis   Hey Guys, Just sat down to read about the first write up that is due this Thursday, and realized that this is supposed to be a group assignment!!  Ooops - I had no idea... Did you ;-) Anyone read the case and/or taken a crack at it? Should we try and co-ordinate a conference call?
