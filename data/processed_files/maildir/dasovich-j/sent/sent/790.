I don't know, though I don't think so. 	Karen Denne 		  Is our white paper on the web somewhere?   		  Dear Enron Public Relation associate. My name is Vi Truong and I am from Boston Pacific Company.  I am interested in Enron's white paper "Fixing What is Broken: what steps are needed to complete california's power markets."  Can you advise me where I can find this paper?  Thank you for your help. Sincerely, Vi Truong 202-296-5520
