Hi.  I was trying to get a fix on whether there's something going on on the  Friday of your Dad's b-day to see if I need to cancel the Houston trip.  What  do you think? xoxoxxo 		  It is going to be pretty casual on Friday!  Sausages, polenta, and salad type  - around the kitchen table - we are pretending his birthday is the next day.   However, your presence would indeed make it more festive and birthday  celebrationy!!

When would you normally get back?  Sonoma Coast Viticulture                                                     contact  cooking!  Coast Viticulture contact  Finally - here is the name of the contact  Nancy, sorry this took a while, but it will be worth it.  If anybody knows  about the Sonoma Coast, it's this guy.  He's done work with Flowers,  Kistler, etc. out there.  His name is Greg Bjornstad (sp.?) and his number  is (707) 829-1687.  He doesn't really know me from a hole in the ground but  you can "double reference" my name as Todd Graff's friend.  Todd is the  winemaker at Sonoma Creek and is a good friend of mine who worked with Eric  on some projects.
