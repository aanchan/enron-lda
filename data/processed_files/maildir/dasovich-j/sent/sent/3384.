We should cast a little broader net on this internally--Yoder, Calger,  Belden, Foster, Sanders, etc.--but seems that, given the Governor's actions  as of late, the likelihood of nonpayment might even be a bit higher than 25%. Best, Jeff 	Harry Kingerski 		  ok swammies - I told Neil I'd gather some input -  my assessment is 25% probability that  payment is not received within one year; probability is nil that it won't be  received at all.  Your thoughts? 		  Michael, With the dissolution of the PX we are exploring various markets in an attempt  to shape our load and minimise our credit exposure to counterparts such as  with selling any volume into the Cal ISO. Currently we are purchasing power  on a daily basis from the market to meet the highest common on and off peak  hour.  This strategy leaves us long for all the other hours but reduces our  exposure to ISO penalties for under scheduling . Our most promising options  are to sell the excess shoulder power into the PX imbalance market or OTC  hour ahead. We are concerned about any receivable from the ISO and would like  to know what you think the probability is of non-payment. If we do receive  payment over what time period can we expect to receive it. NFB
