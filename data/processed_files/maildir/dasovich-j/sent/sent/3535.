Sue Mara was correct on the call yesterday.  While the PUC meets regularly on  Thursdays, it appears they are having a meeting today at which the "Bilas  Alternative" is up for a vote.  Our information is that there is some  breath.  We'll disseminate information just as soon as we get it. Best, Jeff
