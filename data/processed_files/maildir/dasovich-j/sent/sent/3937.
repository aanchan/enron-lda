Thanks.  Best of luck in the prep.  If I can be of any help, you folks know  how to find me. 		 The state submitted an amicus brief which we objected to. The hearing is the  11th.  we are preparing for the hearing.  It is in SF so you are welcome to  come.  Any news from the litigation front with UC/CSU?
