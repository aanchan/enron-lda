works better for me.  Let me know. And Anil has very graciously offered to coordinate the power point  presentation for the project.  And having worked with Anil on another project  that required power point, I can vouch that he is at wizard with the  technology. Best, Jeff 		  I will cancel with Diane for my commitment during Thursday break, so we can definitely meet then. How does meeting on Sunday morning work for everyone? Say around 9am-ish?  - Carolyn Carolyn M.

I agree that we should figure out when we can meet again. I can meet tonight, during break on Tuesday and basically anytime on Saturday or Sunday. During break on Thursday I volunteered to help Diane with a new student's reception, but I can cancel that if need be. What does everyone else's schedule look like? Carolyn M.

It's about 80% of the way there. My brains are oozing out looking at cells, so I want to get this around so Mark can get started on refining assumptions and other folks can examine as well. I'll continue to check it and de-bug it. Mark, you and I should talk, too. (You'll note that at this point, the valuation is in the $30s, so there's work to! do.) Apologies in advance for any errors (and I'm sure they're there). If anyone has any questions on the model, just let me know. I think we ought to get together to meet this week as much as possible to start getting the power point presentation together. And perhaps we should think about meeting this weekend? In the meantime, I'm pulling together the data on Buffet (Berkshire Hathaway) stock performance, etc., and will also do the financial ratios, including Dupont, for OAT. Does this work for folks? Other thoughts?
