Well, get out there and weed, then.   Can't take Annie (too short a trip).   I'm pretty sure that we'll be there.  Make tee times for 9 am?  You can wait  till we see you to pay.  They did charge corkage---just a nice, not too  expensive place. 		  There are a few pesky little weeds around some - not all - the tomatoes. Lots around the melons, some in the herbs and flowers.  So you are not taking Annie with you??  Please scout around for Liz Whiting's car keys. They were in her purse and she can't find them now.  Look under the beds etc. upstairs if you would please. It had to be more than $50 per person!!!  Did they not charge the corkage????????  Shall I mail you a check or wait till you are in  Napa?  We would love to play golf Sunday - I will make a time if you are sure you will be there - what time would you like?? That shirt?????????  Puh-leez. cc:   Just in from watering the west 40.  I think this is going to be our best year ever - lookin' good, lookin' good.  However, there is some serious weeding that someone needs to do!!! I am presuming you guys are stopping in Napa before your dome trek (which is why I thought I could give you a check immediately!).  Is that the case? If so, I hope you can join us in a nummy little repast!  If not, I will put a check in the mail when you let me know the amount.  Unlike some, I always carry my checkbook with me! Those were incredibly beautiful knives that you guys gave Cameron! Nancy (707) 251-4870 (phone) (707) 265-5446 (fax) "Plus je bois, mieux je chante"
