Off what hook? 		  Y'er off the hook, matee. Lysa Akin I have just been advised by Commissioner McIntyre's office that he will NOT  be traveling to Portland this week.  Subsequently (obviously) he has  cancelled his visit to the trading floor scheduled for Oct. 13th.   We will try and coordinate with the Commissioner's office to arrange a visit  at a later date. Lysa Lysa Akin As you know, I have been working with the Commissioner's office to arrange  for Cmmr. McIntyre  to tour the floor when he is in Portland the 12th & 13th of October. Just to update you: The Commr. is unavailable the 12th.  He will be in the office the 13th at  2:00pm Tim Belden has indicated that he is available the 13th, and I have reserved  Mt. St. Helens in his name at 2:00pm. Jake Thomas is out of country and cannot attend. Chris Calger is out of the office the 13th and cannot attend. Paul Kaufman is out of the office and cannot attend. Tim, if you would like my assistance in planning the visit, please let me  know! Lysa x7927 Lysa Akin Cynthia - Here is a map from the hotel to the office. From street level, Commissioner McIntyre will need to take the escalator at  Three (3) World Trade Center up to the main entrance. Inside the double doors is a guard desk.  He needs to sign in and get a Guest  pass.   They will ask him who he is here to see and he should advise Lysa Akin and  give them my extension at 7927. I will then come down and escort him to the floor. Lysa Akin Ass't to Paul Kaufman 503/464-7927
