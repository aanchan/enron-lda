		  ABX 1 passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee moments ago on a vote of 7-2.  The bill received no Republican votes.  I have attached the amended version of the bill for your review.  The bill will be taken up on the Senate floor shortly, then will go back to the Assembly for concurrence this afternoon. http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/bill/asm/ab_0001-0050/abx1_1_bill_20010130_amended_ sen.pdf
