My apologies.  Thank you very much. Best, Jeff 		  HI Jeff, Actually, you were supposed to sign up by friday, but I'll get you on the list now. Cheers, Diane Greetings Diane: Well, the TeleBears on the Web seems to be experiencing some "technical difficulties" and I've thus far been unable to register.  I'll keep trying! In the meantime, I want to make sure that I don't miss any deadlines for the 1-unit courses.  I intend to sign up for the E291-B course (Speaking for Management).  When do I need to sign up by?  Thanks. Best, Jeff
