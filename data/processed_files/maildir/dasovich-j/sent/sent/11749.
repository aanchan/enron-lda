I prepared the following based upon our discussion last Sunday involving our collective review of the contracts.  I provided these to the group today, with the understanding they were darft due to the fact that neither of you have had an opportunity to reivew.  The plan is that tomorrow, the Speaker will be attending a portion of our meeting, and we'll present to him our findings on the agreements.
