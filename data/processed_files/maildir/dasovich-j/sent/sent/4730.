	Jeff Dasovich 	Jeff Dasovich Rosalee:  Could you please print out the following two documents for Mr.  Lay?  One is an excel sheet showing the summary of the results of our  analysis of the core/noncore market structure that Mr. Lay has been  discussing with leaders in California.  The other is a word document  explaining the summary table's contents.  If you have any questions, just let  me know.  Maureen, can you print out for Steve, too?  Thanks very much for  your help. Best, Jeff
