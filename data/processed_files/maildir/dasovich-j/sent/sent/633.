cool.  sorry i couldn't be of more help.  it's meltdown in the land of fruits  and nuts. 	Susan Scott 		 My hero! Jeffery Fawcett As usual, help was only a phone call [to Jeff Dasovich] away.  You 'da man.   I went to the site and found (via reference links) the stats I needed.   Thanks. hmm.  that makes it tougher.  it's crisis central today.  for quick answers  try the ISO website (caiso.com).  i think you can find all that you need. if  not get back to me. 	Jeffery Fawcett 		 yesteday (he says sheepishly) I can help, but what's your timing?
