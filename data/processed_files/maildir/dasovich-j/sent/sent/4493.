how did that happen? 		  DUH cc: change in plans                we are going to have house guests from La Jolla on Sunday, so I don't think that golf would be appropriate - but you guys can still play without us. Let me know before I cancel the tee time. Nancy (707) 251-4870 (phone) (707) 265-5446 (fax) "Plus je bois, mieux je chante"
