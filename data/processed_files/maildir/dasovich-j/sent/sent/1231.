Greetings.  I have a conflict in the morning, but could join by conference  calling beginning at 2 pm.  Is that possible.  If not, no big deal.  I, like  Ralph, will catch up at the next meeting, and submit our ideas to Eve between  now and then.  Let me know.  And I agree with Ralph re: staying focused on  the most urgent issues. Best, Jeff 		  Colleagues:  it turns out that at this hour I will be presiding over hearings  in Wyoming on the disposal of wastes from nuclear weapons (your condolences are gratefully accepted).  I hope to join the next meeting, whenever it is.  My advice remains what I said at our Dec. 1 meeting:  let's try to help the legislature stay focused for now on the most urgent electricity issues that absolutely must be addressed now:  forward contracting in the wholesale  markets to reduce customers' exposure to very high and volatile wholesale prices, and  a rate stabilization plan to deal with the issues surrounding this year's wholesale costs.  If we can help narrow the immediate issues to those, and  frame the differences and decisions that remain, we'll have made a useful contribution. Folks- Ok, so you are the chosen ones...... Just to reiterate the meeting will be on  Tuesday, December 5, 2000  at 10:00 am CA Chamber of Commerce  1215 K Street, 14th Floor Please give me a call if you have any questions or need further details. Thanks, Delaney   CESG Committee Meeting Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit X-Priority: 3 (Normal) X-MSMail-Priority: Normal X-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V5.00.2615.200 X-Loop-Detect: 1
