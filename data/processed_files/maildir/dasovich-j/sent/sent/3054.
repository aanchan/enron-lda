Sorry.  I figured Sandi would have included it.  Why would I have figured  that? 	Jeff Dasovich 	Sandra McCubbin 		  please get back to Jeff or myself on how to respond to Barbara//thanks 		  Hi, Sandi.  Per your request, I talked to Jeff yesterday early evening. I had been in a meeting with Keeley, Wright, et al after the hearing. Jeff's proposal was not entirely clear to me, but it seemed to focus on specifying an end date for the rate freeze in the Hertzberg bill.  I noted that the focus of the Friday hearing and the subsequent meeting was on how much of the short fall the utilities should be able to recover and agreed that we would probably go from one freeze to another.  Therefore the date of the end of the original freeze is rapidly becoming irrelevant unless it is used to create a back way into the first issue.  This does not seem very likely right now.  Who knows how this will evolve, of course, but there is a sense of urgency, at least in the Assembly. Take care, Barbara
