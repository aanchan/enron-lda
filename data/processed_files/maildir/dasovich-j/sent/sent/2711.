I paged you yesterday with the info on size, construction start and  in-service dates. You get it? 	James D Steffes 		  Please look at and comment ASAP.  Need to go out by 12/20 noon. Jim 	Tom Briggs 		  Attached is a draft letter.  I tried to get it down to one page, but it can  use more reduction. I also need info on when the 750MW of capacity will be in  service.  I am leaving on holiday, so someone (like Rick) will have to  complete the letter.
