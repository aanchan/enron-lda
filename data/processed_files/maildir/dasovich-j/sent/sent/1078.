Not one  for inside the bird - but a separate one - does that work?  I'm doing the  cranberries tonight - but if yours is different from normal (!) we can  always have another!       many thanks       for such a fun birthday dinner and such extravagant presents!  My word       -       you guys sure went all out.  Best of course was having you all there.       I       love you!!
