Sounds good. 		 Our messages are getting a little mixed.   So .. to that end, can we have a  bidding for PLR, a GCIM-like mechanism? and (2) rationalize the various  mechanisms if want it all.   I'm confident that we can rationalize all of these mechanism--e.g, we can  limit the percentage of load put up for auction, etc. if we put our minds to  it.  However, we haven't done so yet.   We will discuss this tomorrow in SFO.
