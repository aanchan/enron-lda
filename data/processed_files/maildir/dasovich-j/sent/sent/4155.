Thanks, Dennis.  If  we could get a copy of the analyst's report, it would be  very helpful. Best, Jeff 		 We are a retainer client of PIRA.   We have access to their monthly reports  as well as information available on their website. Dennis Tamara Johnson Dennis, I forwarded Jeff the Friday Platt's Electric Power Daily. The quotes are coming from Allan Stewart of the Pira Energy Group.  Do you  know if we have this group on contract/retainer so that we could see the  predictions they're making? Please let Jeff and me know. Jeff, if we don't have access, you probably have better contacts out there. /Tamara do you have access to the actual report issued by PIRA, to which the article  refers?
