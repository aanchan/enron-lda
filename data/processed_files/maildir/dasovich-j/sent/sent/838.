	Jeff Dasovich OK.  Looks like Saturday's out.  I'm game for tomorrow.  Morning?   Afternoon?  We can meet at my office if you'd like, or at a cafe.  Let me  know. Best, Jeff 		  Hello everyone, I thought I missed something last night - there were four accidents on my  way home so I didn't even get into the city until 7:30 pm.  I checked my  email and didn't see anything so I don't feel so guilty now. I can meet on the weekend whenever. Look who you are talking to...of course we didn't meet.  I'm around this weekend.  Will to work on a spreadsheet before hand.  Otherwise we can meet during break or next Wednesday. Whatta ya think? cc: Meeting?(Document                                           link: Jeff Dasovich)                      11/01/2000 My schedule has blown apart for tomorrow--traveling.  Possible to meet this weekend to discuss the project?  Either day's fine with me.  Apologies for the last minute change.
