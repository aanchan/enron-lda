Note size of folks participanting as reflected in email distribution list.   See attachment, which shows "official" list of coalition members and bullet  points they're passing along to legislators.  Note UC is on the list. Mike:  UC's participation in this coalition can be fairly characterized as  "very active." Best, Jeff 		  Jeff, Per your voice mail, here are the e-mail addresses for the direct access coalition, along with the latest letter of support.

Scott  Direct Access Coalition fact sheet on SB 27x Hello-- I neglected to attach the Direct Access Coalition fact sheet on SB 27x to the media plan I sent out last night.  The document I sent out instead was a fact sheet created specifically for AReM, so please feel free to disregard it.  The attached fact sheet will  need to be updated when the Bowen language is released but remains useful at this time.    <<dacoalition.summary22101.doc Tracy Fairchild Account Supervisor Edelman Public Relations Worldwide (916) 442-2331  - dacoalition.summary22101.doc
