	Joseph Alamo 		  per your respective requests -- please note the comment about it possibly starting late!!! (you'll won't "hear" anything on the audio until they begin). Thanks, Joseph Here is the link to the Senate hearing.  If it doesn't start at 10, don't panic, they tend to be late. http://www.sen.ca.gov/htbin/testbin/noframe_raudio
