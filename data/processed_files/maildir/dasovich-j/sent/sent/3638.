If you're referring to the conversation we had on today's call, it's actually  a bill by Dede Alpert (sp?) that, if signed by the Governor, would cause  demand to go up.  Were you referring to that or something more general? Best, Jeff 	Janel Guerrero 		  is it possible to get a one-pager talking points on the san diego situation  and how the govenor is increasing the demand on the system as we head into  summer?  who can do this?
