That sounds like a very reasonable way to proceed. 		  I plan to start at 10: 00 with those present.   Obviously we'll revisit issues after tomorrow, so anyone who isn't there can express their views later... but I'm inclined to make as much progress as we can rather than to wait for a full quorum.

And I believe Bill Marcus and I are  still meeting with Edison afterward, right John Fielder??  Madame Chair Elsesser:    It appears you may not have a quorum.  I too have a conference call at  10:00  a.m.  I hope to be able to make it over to the Commitee around 11:00-11:30  a.m.    Thank you for your patience.    Tony Braun  Braun & Associates, P.C.  915 L Street  Suite 1460  Sacramento, California 95814  (916) 441-1733  (916) 441-4053 (facsimile)    Counsel to CMUA    cc:    Meeting            Colleagues:  it turns out that at this hour I will be presiding over  hearings in  Wyoming on the disposal of wastes from nuclear weapons (your condolences  are  gratefully accepted).  I hope to join the next meeting, whenever it is.  My  advice remains what I said at our Dec. 1 meeting:  let's try to help the  legislature stay focused for now on the most urgent electricity issues that  absolutely must be addressed now:  forward contracting in the wholesale  markets  to reduce customers' exposure to very high and volatile wholesale prices,  and a  rate stabilization plan to deal with the issues surrounding this year's  wholesale costs.  If we can help narrow the immediate issues to those, and  frame  the differences and decisions that remain, we'll have made a useful  contribution.      Folks-  Ok, so you are the chosen ones......  Just to reiterate the meeting will be on  Tuesday, December 5, 2000  at 10:00 am  CA Chamber of Commerce  1215 K Street, 14th Floor    Please give me a call if you have any questions or need further details.    Thanks,  Delaney     CESG Committee Meeting  Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit  X-Priority: 3 (Normal)  X-MSMail-Priority: Normal  X-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V5.00.2615.200  X-Loop-Detect: 1
