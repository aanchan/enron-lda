It was only a draft.  The commission has to vote it out for it to become  effective.  They've delayed doing that.  Therefore it's status quo on the  SoCalGas system. 		  Jeff - I read this in Com. Bilas' draft final opinion. Are you saying that  the draft final opinion was never truly final?  I am looking for the windowing process and how intrastate capacity is  allocated. Any suggestions? In Commissioner Bilas' draft Final Opinion of the IS (page 51), Socal was  ordered to withdraw advice letter 2837 a file a new advise letter to  implement a revised physical receipt point allocation system.  Was that ever  filed and, if so, can you please send a copy? Regards, Stephanie
