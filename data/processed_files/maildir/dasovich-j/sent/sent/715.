Thanks, Mark.  Sounds good.  As it turns out, there is a very slight chance  that I might be on the panel in California with Prof. Littlechild.  I'll take  you/him up on the offer to get together while he's here.  Best, Jeff 		  Professor Littlechild has written a peper on the importance of retial markets  (being open) to the development of a well-functioning liberalised/deregulated  energy market, i.e., wholesale markets alone to suffice.  As it turns out,  Paul Dawson and Chris Day of my team here in London have reviewed and  commented on earlier drafts of this paper.  We have paid for none of his  research, and there will be no explicit recognition of Enron support for the  work.  However, Littlechild, as Jeff already knows, has been asked to present  his paper to a seminar/conference in California, and to a Tokyo research  institute.  Much of his travel is paid for, but he was not being compensated  for his time in making these trips.  Given that his message is one we want to  get out into the marketplace of ideas, I have agreed to pay him for one day  of his usual professional rate/fees, each, for San Francisco and Tokyo.  In  turn, he has offered to come into our offices (your offices) to meet with  you, discuss his research, and to learn more about your business and your  issues.  May i suggest that if you are interested, and I think this is a  worthwhile way to exchange ideas/views, that you just contact him directly,  referencing that you work with me and I passed along his offer.  I will be  sending to each of you a copy of a monograph I have on the paper (I am not  sure if it is the full piece of work) for your information and future  reference.  Nick - after meeting him, you might inquire as to whether you can  publish his paper on your Japan web-site.  thanks and let me know if you need  any more information.   mcs        	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	                 17/10/2000 11:02 	 Dear Mark Sorry to keep pressing you, but I am not sure whether you received this message and whether the proposed support is acceptable to you.  I received only your subsequent comment that VAT is no problem.  I need to give an answer to Berkeley and Tokyo before I leave in a few hours time. Regards Stephen  Dear Ralph  I have just written a paper on retail  competition in electricity, arguing  that Joskow, Hogan and Ruff, and California,  have got it all wrong, both  in theory and in practice. It is forthcoming  shortly in the DAE and Judge  Institute working paper  series at Cambridge, but I thought you might like  to see a copy now  (attached).  This is obviously a hot issue in California at  present, and this morning I  received an invitation to  participate in a debate there in November (copy  forwarded separately). It seems that Enron is also to be invited. I have  no other commitments in the US at that time. Is is something that Enron  might be interested in supporting, or for that matter developing  further?  We spoke some time ago about the Common Carriage  Consultative Working Hanks.  It was a real eye-opener, to see how little awareness there  was of the  basic conditions conducive to competition, like separate businesses  and  accounts. I'm not sure whether Enron is pursuing this now or not. No  doubt lots of other things going on.  I should be interested to hear from you on retail  competition. I am  copying this to Mark Schroeder and Kyran.  With regards  Stephen  (See attached file: Summary 22Aug2000.doc)  (See attached file: Why we need electricity retailers 22Aug00.doc)
