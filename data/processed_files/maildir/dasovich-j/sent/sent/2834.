FYI.  When I sent Kari Dohn some additional materials today, I mentioned in  passing that I thought the Commission's draft decision fell short.  She  responded by asking why.  Attached is my response, and hers.  Perhaps there's  a glimmer of hope for the IOUs between now and tomorrow. Best, Jeff 		  Hey its worth more than two cents, and I hear you exactly.  We will be busy tonight, that is for sure!!! cc: Materials                  thank you so much.  so the news aint great for utilities? Greetings Kari: Forgive the delay.  Much going on today, PUC draft decision in particular. The draft does not look promising for the utilities' financial position. Attached are our comments on the Governor's Proposals and some more detail on the demand-reduction proposal.  We continue to work on the Nord Pool research for you and will turn that around as quickly as we can. Again, don't hesitate to contact me if there's anything else I can help with, or if there's anything else that you need.
