She's probably fucking wrong! Joanie H Ngo Eric, Could you find some time to look at the new Southern Union contract for  Galveston and Port Arthur?  Pricings are wrong in Sitara so my system  invoices are being understated/overstated each month. If you want, we could sit down and go over it to see what needs to be done.   Let me know. Thanks.
