sounds good just let me know I called and left a message for Huldy for a 2:30 appt.  Dad and I are going to a movie so I won't be here for a few hours.  I'll call and try for a 2:00 at Mandell.  O.k. with you?  LU-M cc:  Good deal.  I think you'll like Bob but, like Dad said, don't feel  obligated.  Don't forget to put the contracts in a folder/envelope and  bring  them along.  How many copies did you make?  I'll call the realtors and see  about tomorrow.  Did you want to see 400 W. Alabama again?  It's usually  open on Sunday. LU-M  cc:       Hi Eric,     Do you want me to check with the realtors to see if those houses are open   this weekend and, if not, do you want me to make appts.?  Let me know.   I'll   do that today.  I would like Dad to see Mandell but that's up to you. He   can't do it today, I don't think.  But, if you would like to see  something   today, I'll try to arrange it.  I would prefer to see all of them the  same   day but I will leave the up to you.  I didn't want you to think that I  have   forgotten about you.  Did you download the contract and make copies?  LU-M   cc:          Did you drive by Huldy?  If so, what did you think?       We can do a contract whenever you want.  Did you call B. Dunn?       Talk to you later.  Love, Mom             It's been so long since we talked, I don't know what I'm supposed to  be     doing.         Just finished real estate school and learned a few things - well, my    memory     was refreshed.  Re: precertification for a loan.  A non-committal    response     from an online source does not mean that you are precertified.  And,   you     must be real careful about all conditions relating to said loan. Dad     thinks     you should call Bob Dunn (call Dad for number.).  Bob is in the   mortgage     business and is a good guy to have on your side.  His office is near   San     Felipe and Voss.  You should probably get this ball rolling so you  are     ready, don't you think?         I am busy today but let me know if you want to see anything Friday.  We     could wait until the weekend to see what's open and make appts. for     whatever     else you want to see.  I recommend that you see a few more before   making    an     offer but that is up to you.         Let me know what I can do.  LU-M              Any news?           -e
