Thanks. I am looking for volumes that traded last year - not necessarily volumes that  flowed.  Volumes that flowed include term transactions. Can you think of a way to find this info? Eric     	Enron Capital Management 	 	 Hope this is what you were looking for. Here are the total volumes by quarter and by region.  We are looking into the  EOL since we do not have currently have regional information.  Perhaps you  have a way of estimating based on CPR?
