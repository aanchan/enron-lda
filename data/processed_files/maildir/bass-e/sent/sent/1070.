Sorry for this mass e-mail, but you have got to see this ... be careful if you are viewing this at work or anywhere public.  I know there are a few of you I haven't been in touch with for a while, but please forgive me as I've been tied up in a shithole in Paducah, KY.  I hope all is well with you.  Enjoy this e-mail.  BTW - Jared, this is a REAL forward ... send me more of this stuff instead of the other crap that comes my way! Adios, Patrick If only I knew who these girls were!
