touchy, touchy.  if you look at garner's stats he is very consistent (about  15 pts. a game) - the game last week helped his cause but he has been good  all year. My best offer is Freeman, Garner, and Beasley for Anderson/Watters and Taylor. Let me know The third highest because of one Extraordinary week...  My "Shitty" receivers have outscored Toomer, he blows this year, I have no need for another blow hard receiver.  Jeff George has the same value as last week.. Johnson is injury prone and one game will not make up for the last 3.  He will falter again. Jason Bass TSE Compaq Computer Corporation cc: No thanks.  I will shop. Jason Bass TSE Compaq Computer Corporation cc: Garner, Robinson and Walls For Taylor and George Think about it hard because that is all I can do and I am going to start shopping Taylor around Jason Bass TSE Compaq Computer Corporation Alright, you know now that you need to trade Taylor - what do you want for him?
