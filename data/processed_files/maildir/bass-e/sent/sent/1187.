both - since they are right next to each other do you want to see one or two?  LU-M cc:  Hi Eric,  2405 Mandell looks really good.  HCAD app. $267500.  2401 Mandell sold on 8/29/00 for $279900 in 6 days.  These are Silvestri  townhomes which I think are a cut above Perry.  HCAD for 2402 (Perry) is  $271800, not much less than asking price.  This is a patio home.  How many  townhomes/patio homes would you estimate are on the street?  Do you want to  try to see 2405 also?  LU-M   these two are right across the street     http://www.har.com/search/condo/indexdetail.cfm?mlnum=526225     http://www.har.com/search/condo/indexdetail.cfm?mlnum=527102
