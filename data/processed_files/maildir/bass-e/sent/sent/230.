3 of us are going up Friday and we are staying with a friend of one of the  guys in the group. Hi E, I'm glad to see you are having a good time with your friends.  How many are going?  Where are you staying? Talk to you later.  LU-M cc:  Hi E,  Well, I'm thinking about voting for Gore - NOT!  I will, however, not  mention another word re: election.  Everything else is fine here.  I talked with Jason today to wish him a  happy  26th.  He was online with Ticketmaster and got last minute tickets in the  front row of the "pit".  He's very excited.  Do you like the group he's  going to see?  I'm not familiar with them.  How is work?  Are you going to Austin this weekend?  Tell Shanna to have a  nice time at the wedding.  LU-M  cc:  Good Morning, Eric-  I assume you received my message yesterday but were  too busy to respond.  That's o.k. As a postscript though, I bought  your Dad a new Marine  sweatshirt so you can keep the other one. And, I got  another bill from  Blockbuster for late fees. Perhaps it would be best if  you get your own  account. Have a wonderful day.   LU-M
