what sounds good. next week or thurs? Sounds Good.   cc:   My weekend was ok.  Sorry if I stopped by at a bad time on Thursday!  I've   had a migraine for the last two days, and it still hasn't gone away, so I'm   not feeling 100% today.  I won't be able to get together until after   Wednesday or so, if that is all right, I have so much going on in  school   this week.  Keep in touch and let me know what day is good for you!   -Dee
