40/20 Eric, Is the weekly pot divided or is it winner take all? Jason Bass TSE Compaq Computer Corporation cc: I would consider a deal for Taylor, but I won't give up George.  He, in my estimation, will be starting very soon. Jason Bass TSE Compaq Computer Corporation cc: Eric, I will tell you that it will have to be an offer that I can't refuse.  You are actually going to maybe take the short end of the stick.  I have done without him for 4 weeks and he is back this coming week and I am looking forward to having him in the lineup. Jason Bass TSE Compaq Computer Corporation What do you want for Taylor?
