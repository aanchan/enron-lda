Michael is a happily married man.  He would never think about any other girl  but Sheila - or so he tells me.  Now, I, on the other hand.  Uhhhhh ....  wait, never mind! I am free pretty much every day for lunch this week, I won't know until later  in the week about next week.  What does your schedule look like this week and next week?  So, does michael like my sis or what?   cc:   Yes I did.  I was just thinking about you.  I'm really glad you showed up.   I'm also sorry to hear about your grandma.  I will keep her in my prayers.   I had a fun and relaxing weekend, and I'm really glad you were a part of it   :-).  Did you have fun?             did you have a good birthday weekend?
