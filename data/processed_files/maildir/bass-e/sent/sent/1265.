However, we were going to play this weekend but there are a lot of people who are unable to play due to previous engagements so we are going to reschedule it for Saturday, January 20, 2001.  It will cost about $22.00 and that includes admission for the whole day, rental of the gun and one Co2 cartridge.  However, paintballs are extra and they cost about $6.50 per 100.  If we do end up playing it would be recommend to bring a sandwich and drinks because there is not much out there. If you could, please RSVP by Wednesday, January 17, 2001, that way we can decide if we have enough people to even play.  Rain or Shine! Thank you, George Kissamis
