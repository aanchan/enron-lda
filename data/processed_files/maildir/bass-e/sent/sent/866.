If you want me to take care of her, let me know.  I'm not scared of her  either! OK- you don't think that the roommate is a little bit touchy about the time  that you and I have been spending together?!?!?  See what I have to deal  with.  Knowing full and well that when she was dating Chad- I literally went  6 days without seeing her. I think I can call him your boyfriend because you are spending every minute outside of work with him.
