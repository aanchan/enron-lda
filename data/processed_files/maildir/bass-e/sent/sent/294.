that bid won't be there next week :( I am going to play with Taylor one week.  I have been waiting this long.  I know I am blowing a real good deal, but I will come to you next week, after I see what he can do. Jason Bass TSE Compaq Computer Corporation cc: That sounds viable.  Give me a little time to mull it over.  I commend you decent offer :) Jason Bass TSE Compaq Computer Corporation cc: I am happy with my Tight End and Garner has proven less valuable than Watters thus far this season. Jason Bass TSE Compaq Computer Corporation cc: Eric, Let me know if I have Anderson or not.  If I have Morton I want to pick him up and drop my other kicker.  If I don't have Morton do the same thing except pick Hanson up instead of Anderson Jason Bass TSE Compaq Computer Corporation 713-853-0977
