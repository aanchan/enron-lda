Those look good, thanks. Eric Please take a CLOSE LOOK at what's in DRAFT, and if you approve I'll put  these out. Dale     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 That looks good, but I need an index based product for July for the HPL/HSX  Pool (not the east pool) Thanks, Eric Take a look at what's in DRAFT and if it looks okay I'll activate the Product. Lot's of manual intervention.............................. Dale     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 I am trying to create the WkD for other areas beside HPL/HSX E but keep  getting an error msg for length.   Is there a way to truncate these products  so that we can trade them on eol?   Thanks, Eric
