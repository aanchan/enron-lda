Hi Eric, We have reservations for 6:30 Sat.  Is that o.k.?  It's a very small restaurant and that's the best I could do.  We look forward to seeing you and Shanna.  Jason declined.  LU-M  Atmosphere is ??? We like it. It is near our home. Say 6-6:30? Mother needs  to make reservations. Let us know ASAP.-L  cc:         Good evening Son. Seems like forever since we have  talked. Hope your  week   was good and next week is better. Lets get together for  lunch or dinner   next week. Stay in touch. Love  you-Dad
