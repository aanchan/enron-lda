well, nobody ever said that sheila was the sharpest knife in the drawer . . .  but oh well, it is her body Apparently the doctor says it's ok... I bet she said that she was better, but  not "hey, it's ok to go out, drink and dance in a room full of smoke and people."  I went to the doctor yesterday and she said I'm much better.  Trust me, I haven't been out in an entire month, I am SO ready to do some drinking and dancing! Thanks for emailing Brian.  cc:  Hi Hector -  I hope you're still planning on coming out with us tonight.  I promise  we'll  be there!  I was wondering if you wouldn't mind calling Brian and telling  him about tonight.  I remember you said he comes back from his ski trip  today.  Will he be in the office today?  If not, then can you please call  him and let him know about dinner at 8:30 and dancing afterwards?
