no i haven't driven by yet.  i would like to see the mandell house again  before putting a contract in on it. -e Did you drive by Huldy?  If so, what did you think? We can do a contract whenever you want.  Did you call B. Dunn? Talk to you later.  Love, Mom  It's been so long since we talked, I don't know what I'm supposed to be  doing.  Just finished real estate school and learned a few things - well, my memory  was refreshed.  Re: precertification for a loan.  A non-committal response  from an online source does not mean that you are precertified.  And, you  must be real careful about all conditions relating to said loan.  Dad  thinks  you should call Bob Dunn (call Dad for number.).  Bob is in the mortgage  business and is a good guy to have on your side.  His office is near San  Felipe and Voss.  You should probably get this ball rolling so you are  ready, don't you think?  I am busy today but let me know if you want to see anything Friday.  We  could wait until the weekend to see what's open and make appts. for  whatever  else you want to see.  I recommend that you see a few more before making an  offer but that is up to you.  Let me know what I can do.  LU-M   Any news?     -e
