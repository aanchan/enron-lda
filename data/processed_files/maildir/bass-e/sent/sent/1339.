Funny . . . that is where I was planning on going My group is going to Kenneally's I think like at 5 or 6.  It won't be as big  as your group but it sure would be a coincidence if ya'll were playing golden  tee there.     	 	 	                            	 I remember you sponging off my group for drinks, how about a little payback? my group is having a happy hour today so i'm out but i'll go out if anyone's  up for it You have a status? Whatever... I think I should be there... my status is questionable now.
