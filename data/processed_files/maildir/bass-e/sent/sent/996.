Can we set this up for next Tuesday morning? Thanks, Eric     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Would you please set this up with them? A reminder that we would like to meet with each of the regional desks to  discuss December earnings.  If possible, we would like to meet Mon. or Tues.  of next week (Jan. 10). Please call with any questions. Thank You, Sean 3 3928
