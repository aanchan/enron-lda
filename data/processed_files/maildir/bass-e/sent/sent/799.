Have you heard anything on the sitara issues? Thanks, Eric     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Can you help me out here?  I don't have the details in the attached E-mail.   So I need to understand what the product is so that we can determine the  "back office" issues.  Apparently, time frame is short.  So I appreciate the  info ASAP.  Thanks. Edward D Gottlob Brenda, can you get someone to work through the issues the back office may  have.  I would like to get this product up and running before the end of  April.  EDG     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 FYI.  There might be some back office issues with this.   My peice of this, the language component, is easy to do. The trouble comes in  with logistics. We need to check with the Sitara Group to see if this is  feasible. In the OTC world it's a lay-up because you can enter the different  legs into the system and skip the weekends. The issue re: doing this on EOL  is the ability of the system NOT TO NOMINATE on certain dates. Scott Mills is out on vacation until Monday and he's the man I have to see. I  will follow up with him next week. Dale 3-9746
