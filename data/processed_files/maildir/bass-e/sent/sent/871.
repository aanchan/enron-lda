Don't get testy. I wasn't trying to get you upset.  I thought we were having  a normal conversation.  It just didn't seem like you were talking as much as  usual. Read too much into you???  How can I read too much into you when I don't know  how to read you at all.  Half the time when you say something- I have no idea  what you are really trying to say.     	 	 	 I'm fine. I think you read too much into me.  Besides, I'm just trying to find the best way to deal with your attitude!  (ha! ha!) e OK- what is your probelm this morning?     	 	 	 Bright, articulate, attractive, charming, reserved but, most of all, she admires and respects someone I love.  What a gal!  I'm glad you work for a "for profit" company!  Enjoyed the evening.  LU-M
