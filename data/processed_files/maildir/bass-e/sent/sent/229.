in I received an invitation in the mail to purchase Rockets tickets online 2  days earlier than they go on sale to the general public.  The opener is Tues  in the cheap seats, so you can listen to comments such as "I'm gonna let you  hear it-AIRBALL!," and "He just made Sportscenter."  If you want to go to the  game let me know  and I will buy the tickets this week.
