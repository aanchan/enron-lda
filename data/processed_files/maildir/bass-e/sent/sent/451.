ok, you want something fair, and you want dillon and davis in a package? how about dillon and davis, for your whole team b/c that is the only trade  that i think is fair for my team  let me know what you think Phillip M Love I do not think your trade offer was fair.  I get a downgrade at running back,  a downgrade at receiver and an extra back who has not had a carry in the NFL  since 1998.  Thanks for being fair.  Count me out. PL
