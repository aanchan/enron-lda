Hey Mom, I would like to see the Mandell and the Huldy - preferably tomorrow before  4ish.  Let me know if that works for you.  Dad is welcome to see whichever  houses he would like. FYI, I am meeting with Bob Dunn today after work, and I made copies of the  contracts. L, E Hi Eric, Do you want me to check with the realtors to see if those houses are open this weekend and, if not, do you want me to make appts.?  Let me know.  I'll do that today.  I would like Dad to see Mandell but that's up to you.  He can't do it today, I don't think.  But, if you would like to see something today, I'll try to arrange it.  I would prefer to see all of them the same day but I will leave the up to you.  I didn't want you to think that I have forgotten about you.  Did you download the contract and make copies?  LU-M cc:  Did you drive by Huldy?  If so, what did you think?  We can do a contract whenever you want.  Did you call B. Dunn?  Talk to you later.  Love, Mom       It's been so long since we talked, I don't know what I'm supposed to be   doing.     Just finished real estate school and learned a few things - well, my  memory   was refreshed.  Re: precertification for a loan.  A non-committal  response   from an online source does not mean that you are precertified.  And, you   must be real careful about all conditions relating to said loan.  Dad   thinks   you should call Bob Dunn (call Dad for number.).  Bob is in the mortgage   business and is a good guy to have on your side.  His office is near San   Felipe and Voss.  You should probably get this ball rolling so you are   ready, don't you think?     I am busy today but let me know if you want to see anything Friday.  We   could wait until the weekend to see what's open and make appts. for   whatever   else you want to see.  I recommend that you see a few more before making  an   offer but that is up to you.     Let me know what I can do.  LU-M        Any news?       -e
