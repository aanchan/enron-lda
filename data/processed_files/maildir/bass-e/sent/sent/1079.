it is a complex on revere street which is just east of kirby on westheimer.   it is where james used to live. they have 1bedroom/studies so that is nice. Which apartment?  Have you looked?  I like that area for you.  I'm fine. Hope to see you again soon.  LU-M cc: Hi Eric, Just checking in. How are you? Anything  new? Are you still planning to move in the near future? Have a great  day.
