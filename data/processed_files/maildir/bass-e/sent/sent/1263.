i don't think we are going to be able to make it out that way tonight.  but  we will see you at Pappasitos at 8:00 tomorrow (the Kirby and Richmond  location). It is at 8:30.  We are supposed to be there at 8 to get all seated together. This is the Laff Spot on 249 and 1960.  Come up the Beltway and go left on 249.  Exit Greens road and go through two lights.  It will be in strip shopping center on your right side, about a quarter of a mile past Circuit City.  It is in the same shopping center as a bar called Frogs Saloon. Donnita's cell phone is 832-577-8235, in case you get lost. Jason Bass Compaq Portables  <<...OLE_Obj... cc: What time are we meeting tomorrow and will you two be able to make it tonight?
