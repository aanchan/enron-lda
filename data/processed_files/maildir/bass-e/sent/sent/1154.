damn . . . are you going to take that Big talk for a guy whose school is on NCAA probation as we speak.   http://www.ncaa.org/databases/db1/probation.html By the way, I see from the latest RPIs that LSU is really pulling their  weight as the lowest-ranked team in the SEC, right behind Austin Peay.

Excerpt from an article on espn.com Given Kentucky's decades-long legacy of cheating in both basketball and  football,                   ousting Mumme was a mandatory move.
