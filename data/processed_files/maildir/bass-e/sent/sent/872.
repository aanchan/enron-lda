I'm fine. I think you read too much into me.  Besides, I'm just trying to find the best way to deal with your attitude!  (ha! ha!) e OK- what is your probelm this morning?     	 	 	 Bright, articulate, attractive, charming, reserved but, most of all, she admires and respects someone I love.  What a gal!  I'm glad you work for a "for profit" company!  Enjoyed the evening.  LU-M
