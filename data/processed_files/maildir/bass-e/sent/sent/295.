have you decided?  I am not trying to rush you - but I am leaving early today  for Austin - so I need to set my lineup before I leave! Let me know That sounds viable.  Give me a little time to mull it over.  I commend you decent offer :) Jason Bass TSE Compaq Computer Corporation cc: I am happy with my Tight End and Garner has proven less valuable than Watters thus far this season. Jason Bass TSE Compaq Computer Corporation cc: Eric, Let me know if I have Anderson or not.  If I have Morton I want to pick him up and drop my other kicker.  If I don't have Morton do the same thing except pick Hanson up instead of Anderson Jason Bass TSE Compaq Computer Corporation 713-853-0977
