engram is ramiro's 4th receiver, you don't get a starting rb (the 10th best i  might add) for a backup WR.   the reason i want engram so bad is b/c i have his qb and i think he will have  a pretty good year. by the way engram was picked the 8th round, dillon in the 2nd. so don't give me any of that Ramiro believes Engram is going to have a very good year.  He needs a Running Back.  I don't think he is being ridiculous.  Engram may be ranked 30th now, but you obviously believe he is a little better than that or you wouldn't want him so bad.
