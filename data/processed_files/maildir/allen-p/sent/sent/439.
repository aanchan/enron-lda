Phillip, we can get the school to agree to limit the current land use restrictions to the terms that are in the existing agreement.  They do not want the school to come back at a later date for something different.  Doug Bell will meet with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the the March 29 hearing.  We may close this deal in April. The Stage is still on go.  An assumption package has been sent to the buyer, and I have overnighted a copy of the contract and a description of the details to Wayne McCoy. I will be gone Thurs. and Fri. of this week.  I will be checking my messages. Jeff Smith The Smith Company 2714 Bee Cave Road, Suite 100-D Austin, Texas? 78746 512-732-0009 512-732-0010 fax 512-751-9728 mobile
