    	 	 	 To make a long story short. Williams is long 4000MW of tolling in SP15 (SoCal )  for 20 years (I know I  did the deal) on Tuesday afternoon, Williams sold 1000 MW to Merrill Lynch for the  remaining life (now 18 years) Merrill is short fixed price gas at So Cal border  up to 250,000MMBtu a day  and long SP15 power (1000 MW) a day. heat rate 10,500  SoCal Border plus $0.50. I'm not sure if MRL has just brokered this deal or is warehousing it. For what its worth........
