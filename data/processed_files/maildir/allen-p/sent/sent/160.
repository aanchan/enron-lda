Michael Etringer I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to Clark County PUD.  They  have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000.  Could you  give me a basis for the period : Sept -00 - May 31, 2006 Sept-00 - May 31, 2008 Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off  Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an  adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread  be on these terms. Thanks, Mike
