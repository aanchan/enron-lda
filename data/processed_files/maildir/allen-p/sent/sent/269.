Should I appeal to Skilling. Phillip - I applaud you for using your cycle as daily transportation.  Saves on gas,  pollution and helps keep you strong and healthy.  Enron provides bike racks  in the front of the building for requests such as this.  Phillip, I wish we  could accommodate this request; however, The Body Shop does not have the  capacity nor can assume the responsibility for storing cycles on a daily  basis.  If you bring a very good lock you should be able to secure the bike  at the designated outside racks.   Keep Pedalling - Lee
