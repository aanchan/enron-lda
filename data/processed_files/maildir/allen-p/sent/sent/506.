Everything is short and sweet except the caption!  One comment.  The very  last sentence reads :  PG&E can continue to physically divert gas if  necessary . . . "  SInce they haven't actually begun to divert yet, let's  change that sentence to read "PG&E has the continuing right to physically  divert gas if necessary..."   I will send this around for comment.  Thanks for your promptness. Any comments, anyone? 		  Leslie: Here is the draft.  Short and sweet.  Let me know what you think.  We will be ready to file on Friday.  Mike Day  <<X20292.DOC  - X20292.DOC
