Griff,    Can you accomodate Dexter as we have in the past.  This has been very helpful  in establishing a fair index at Socal Border. Phillip Please cc me on the email with a guest password.  The sooner the better as  bidweek is underway. Phillip, I was wondering if I could trouble you again for another guest id for eol. In previous months, it has helped us here at NGI when we go to set indexes. I appreciate your help on this. Dexter
