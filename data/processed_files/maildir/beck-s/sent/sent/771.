FYI - People tend to forget that we have some parts of the business that run  24 hours a day.  We often get notices like the one sent on March 29 below  without much lead time and without regard to potential business impact.  Bob  Superty has done a good job in scrambling to provide business solutions for  us in gas scheduling.  This is a good team that knows how to react quickly.   --Sally  Robert Superty Sally, Bob - FYI  I was able to get 5 telephone numbers set up on a temporary switch so if our  counterparties call into the Enron building during the outage (Friday 10:00  that we selected. The voicemail gives the caller contact info. (page & home  #'s). In addition if they hit zero it will be forwarded to our off-hours  dispatching service. The dispatching service has current contact information  for every pipe we do business on.  The schedulers were also instructed to  call out to their key counterparties and make sure they have page, home and  cell #'s. If I had my way all of our schedulers telephone numbers would have been put  on this temporary switch but five was the best we could do. Considering the  time period I think we have minimal exposure however you never know when a  pipeline of market emergency could occur.  Let me know if you have any questions, tks - Bob     	Enron North America Corp.
