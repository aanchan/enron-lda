I heard this morning from Susan Harrison that Sandra had submitted a letter  of resignation to Bryce Baxter, who reports to Susan.  I have not talked  directly with Bryce and I have not seen the resignation letter to date this  afternoon.   I have left a message for Bryce and I will get with him on  Tuesday morning to see a copy of the letter and then can leave you a message  after that.  --Sally  Sally and Kim what is the status???????     	 	 	 Does this mean she's quitting?  SRS Jeff/Sherri, Wanted to keep you posted on this. Without gettting into too many details on  the conversations with Cindy Olson, Sally Beck, and Kim Melodick, I have  decided to  bring this to closure myself and will submit my resignation to my manager  this morning. Thanks again. Sandra x-5-7213     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Sandra, I learned that this morning.  Please keep Jeff informed...thanks, SRS Sherri, You probably already know this, but I will be meeting with Cindy Olson and  again. S     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Thank you, Sandra.  I'll make sure Jeff sees it again as soon as possible.   SRS
