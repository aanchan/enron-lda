Thought you might like to see this note from Max on the doorstep review in  Monterrey.  Beth is a great addition and has made a very positive impact  already.  --Sally  Beth: Thanks for the note regarding Gordon.  I appreciate the quick turnaround time  on it, and I agree that he should be a helpful addition to the team. Put me down as a fan of the doorstop review process. Best regards - Max
