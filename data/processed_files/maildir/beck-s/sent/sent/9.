I will call you tonight!   thanks--would it be easier to read it to me over the phone so you don't have to type it tomorrow? cc: Hey--how was your weekend--fudge delivered? Got my bake sale item done--an 18 layer cookie tower.  Have 9 houses baked with 3 to go. Now to show that I really have gone nuts--I thought I would cook breakfast for the 2nd grade at school on Friday morning....can I have your breakfast pizza recipe?  We all thought it was great and I think the kids will think it is fun.... Thanks! Cindy
