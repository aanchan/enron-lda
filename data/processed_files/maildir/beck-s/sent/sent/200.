This request is approved.  Your request forms that you send still don't  provide enough information in layman's terms so that I know what you are  asking to be approved.  Are we working on this?  Rebecca Ford Greg Carraway is a member of my group.  Since Brad Diebner is no longer in  Financial Settlements, I am trying to set up Greg with access to the terminal  server so that he can use a laptop from home.  It is part of the inclement  weather plan.  I didn't know the approval would go to you, otherwise I would  have prompted you for the approval. Thank you, Becky     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 I can never tell from these things what they are asking to be approved.    Since Gregory's address looks as if he is at Corp., just let me know who he  is and what I am being asked to approve.  Please reply with history  attached.  Thanks. --Sally  Information Risk Management Below you will find a copy of a request that is awaiting your approval.
