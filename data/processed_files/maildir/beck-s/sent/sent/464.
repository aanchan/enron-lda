Thanks for the reminders.  Hopefully, this will take care of this.       	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 FYI Patti     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Mary, As Brent Price is out of the country until July & I am travelling out of the  country more frequently, I would like to temporarily designate Susan Harrison  as a signer.  Susan is the Director of our off-system Settlements & Volume  Management groups.  This temporary designation will ensure that we maintain  appropriate signing coverage while Brent & I are unavailable. Thanks, Sally
