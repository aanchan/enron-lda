Laurel, She has business travel Tuesday & Wednesday, and vacation 1/2 Thursday and  Friday. Patti Laurel Adams All, Sheila will be on vacation next week, and we'll be looking for someone to  sign any manual wires.  We have further reduced the amount, so it should only  be 1-2/day.    Thank you very much for your help!  Ana Rizvi will most likely  be the person calling for a signature.
