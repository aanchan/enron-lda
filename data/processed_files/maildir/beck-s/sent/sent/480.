Amanda is at camp from Sunday, May 28 until Saturday, June 10.  Then Meagan  leaves on Sunday, June 11 and will return on Saturday, June 24.  If we decide  to do a family vacation, it would be either the week of June 26, July 3 or  July 10.  After that, Meagan starts Bearkadette practices through school  start in August, with a few days at Bearkadette camp July 20-24.  Looks as if  we will have one girl or the other with us at any point during the summer,  unless Amanda schedules her Austin visit during one of Meagan's two stints at  camp.  Let me know when you want to talk dates.   Sally - Great!  THanks for the reply.  I'm glad those are the earrings. Yes, I hope things start getting better for M & D.   I do want to come for a visit.   Chris and I haven't even had a chance to talk about it.  We will do that so you and I can talk dates.    Since we'll probably get to see Amanda while she's here (and Meagan's pretty booked anyway) , I wonder if it might be fun to visit you guys when it's just you and Tyler - that way we'll get lots of time with you guys and Mr. T?      -Cara  cc:  HI, Sal.  Well, I guess Meagan told you that I went ahead and called her  since I was headed up to James Avery - and realized time is running out!  I think I found the earrings she wants, but I wanted to make sure.  They  are  really TINY gold studs, in the shape of very gold hearts.   Does that  sound  right?  (She said she has silver ones just like them but wants gold.)   If  those are the ones, I'll have those sent to her.  Hope you had a good weekend.  We had a social one - friends over for  drinks  on Friday (we have christened the bucket, by the way!); dinner party on  Saturday; babtism/brunch on Sunday . . . I pulled up Enron's web site the  other day and printed out an article about the company just for fun -  thought I should learn more about it.   Interesting stuff.    Love, C.
