Requesting update access for what?  (can't tell from this request what it is  that you want me to approve)  Is this request for Sheila Glover or Rebecca Ford?  (unclear)  Next to Sheila's name is the word Trader.  Is this supposed to be her  title?   She is not a trader.  She is a Business Controller.   Can you provide some clarification so that I can act upon this?  Thanks for  your earlier phone message, Leola.  This is still a bad process and the  information is not sufficient to give an approval.   Information Risk Management Below you will find a copy of a request that is awaiting your approval.
