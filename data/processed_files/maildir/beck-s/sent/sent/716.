I would recommend floor meetings on 37 (we occupy almost the entire floor)  and on the operations end of floor 32.  That would cover everyone pretty  well.  Thanks. --Sally  Hi Sally - Taking care of Philippe's emails while he's out.  Are there one or two floors  that are occupied fully by your groups?  Please tell me the floors (probably  two) where you would like the meetings and I will call Patti to coordinate  your availability to attend.  I'll then send an email to your people  notifying them of such.   Thanks,  Peggy READ We will be holding floor meetings on the following dates.
