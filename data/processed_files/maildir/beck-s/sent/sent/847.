Looks like a permanent cancellation to me - at least for now!  We can work  with Wes on the best ways to stay abreast of developing deals that impact  Enron Americas.       	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Please note that Wes Colwell's Bi-weekly Hot List meeting has been cancelled,  please remove these meetings from your calendar.  If you have any questions,  please feel free to call myself or Michele Beffer at ext. 57681.  FYI, the  next meeting was scheduled for 2/22 at 1:30pm.
