Please print the attachment at end of e:mail in color for me.  Thanks.  --Sally      	 	 	                            	 Thought you might want to see what we are preparing for the DealBench team.   This was our first third party auction.  Although we had some major technical  issues (the site went down for over an hour between auctions), Sabre saved  over $500,000 which hopefully made up for the down time.  My team did an  excellent job calling the auction participants and reacting very quickly as  the site was brought back up.   Let me know if you have any questions. Sheri Hello, The Sabre, Inc. auction summary report is attached. The report is also  located in the Auction Deal online. Please let me know if you have any  comments or feedback. Thank you, Andrea x54420
