We are making some progress with the timeliness of London information.  More  to come... Chris Abel I appreciate the flash P&L that you are now providing.  That should help  everyone get an early morning picture of what is going on in London.  Have  you had an opportunity to address the need for European VaR numbers at the  same time in the morning? James New We in London shall be producing a flash P&L from today Monday the 18th of  December. This will be sent to Shona's group at 1pm London time which  Ibelieve is in good time for the P&L consolidation group. Any queries please let me know. James
