Have fun in Wharton -- remember that Hines BBQ is the best bet in town.   Leave room for the pie!  Let's review calendars so that we can pin point a  time for you or you and Chris to visit.  ( I will keep that date  confidential, so that it will be reserved for you.)  --Sally  Yes, it's good to have my hubby back!   Am going to Wharton tomorrow to meet with Trav - as far as we can tell, the Wharton County Tennis Assoc. is the oldest in the state and I'm going to write an article about them.  Hope all is well.  Hello to all!   Love, Cara  cc:  Hi, Sal.   Just checking in with you.  I called Friday and talked with  Tammy; I wasn't sure if you'd get the message.  Have you had a chance to  comb through the James Avery catalogue (or think of any other ideas?) for  Meagan's birthday?   Hope you're well.   E-mail back when you can!   Love,  C.
