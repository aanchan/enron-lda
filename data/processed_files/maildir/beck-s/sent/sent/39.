Thanks for including me.  Unfortunately, I will be out of town at an offsite  meeting with the ENA management team from December 13 - 16.  --Sally  Sue Foust Scott and Lanette's baby is due late in January.   I hope you can attend  their baby shower on Friday, December 15th.  We'll forward the location of  the shower soon. Regards, Sue Sharon Stringfellow
