I told  Tom last week that I have a standing systems meeting on Thursdays at  9:00, so this change doesn't work for me.  Can we try 10:00 am on Thursday  this week?  Thanks. --Sally      	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 FYI     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Brenda, w/ Rick Buy, Philippe Bibi, Beth Perlman and others - I think it is to deal  with all the systems problems we have been having lately). Patti Meeting Change Notice for 11/8 Next week's weekly update meeting will be held on Thursday morning, Nov. 9th  in EB 21C1 from 9:00am - 10:00am instead of Wednesday.  Please plan to  attend.
