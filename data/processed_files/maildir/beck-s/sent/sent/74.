Pecan pie would be great - I have tried but do not do that very well, but I  love it.  I will probably make pumpkin chiffon and lemon/raspberry pie, so  pecan would be a great addition.  Mom is going to do the rolls.   We will put the reserved sign on the guest room for you  -  improvements in  those quarters as well.  I recently cleaned out the guest room closet, bought  new towels and have ordered new luggage racks.  We will use the old luggage  racks in the media room.  Cool new blanket for the sofa bed in there,  however, so Cara and Chris won't suffer too much.   Cool--although I did tell little C that since I was big C Richard and I were taking the guest room!  I am such a lovely sister, yes? Richard really, really loves pecan pie--I may try and make it and bring it if that is ok with you....or I may just bring one from Luby's.... Really--a pound of coffee would make him very happy for his birthday... See you soon-- Cindy cc: Hi... Still trying to think of things for Richard.  Electric can opener, Guatemalan Antigua coffee, new shirt for racquetball--he says XXL--hard to find but most chain sporting good stores have that size--probably white or something very basic with a collar.  He really does need this--his racquetball duds are looking pretty bad... We are looking forward to Thanksgiving--can't believe it is next week! What can we bring? Cindy
