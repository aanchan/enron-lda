Buried somewhere in these e:mail messages is a resume.  Please print for me  and put it in a resume folder (along with some others that I have in my  outbox).  I will need to review them when I am back.  Thanks.      	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Dear Sally, This person comes as very highly recommended (my husband says she is one of  the best people he has ever worked with).  Do you have any suggestions on who  could use her business development skills? Thanks Hi Shona, Tandra does look like a good candidate.  We are holding up on our  open reqs for now, however, will pass onto IT. Regards Hi Shona.  Randy told me to send my information.  I'm interested in hearing about some of the opportunities you have to offer.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.  <<Tandra.DOC Thanks,  Tandra Coleman  www.fuelquest.com 713-222-5798  - Tandra.DOC << File: Tandra.DOC
