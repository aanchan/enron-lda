Please print a color copy for me of the two attachments to Kate's memo.   Thanks.  Joe, Mike and Kent Thank you again for your offices' assistance  when we visited last week. I have attached the drafts of the Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires reports.  Please  review and let me know  any comments or questions.  We are trying to finalize the reports as soon as  possible so your response is greatly appreciated. Regards Kate Agnew
