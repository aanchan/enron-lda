It's getting harder and harder to root, root, root for the home team.   I KNOW!!!  I was even in San Francisco ...!!  How humiliating... Apparently, you were not cheering hard enough. cc: Just read it...great article! Have fun in Costa Rica... I hear it is amazing. cc: What do you mean?  I'm serious! So what Fortune article?  I only saw you in Time...  Pretty freaky to see someone you know like that!  What the heck is a "chief" of natural gas derivatives?!  Skilling's old job? friends were in the press lately (i.e. YOU, as well as all my HBS buddies), so the guys on the trading floor thought this would be funny.  The best part is that someone thought they were serious and started in on the conversation!!  I do investor relations for a hedge fund in Dallas, so that's why they are talking about my IR/selling skills... but it's not exactly your typical corporate IR position considering our investor base. I'm going to be in your neck of the woods tomorrow.  I'm visiting friends in Houston on Friday & Saturday, then going to my sister's house in Bay City on Sat. night.  No firm plans, just getting out of Dallas.  Are you going to be around? I thought about you the night after I saw the article because I was in Snuffers, drinking a strawberry daiquiri...    =)  do you remember why?? I think about that every time I go there.... Take care and make money! cc: Is this "the 26-year-old chief of natural-gas derivatives"?  If so, you should write me back after you complete your "nine hours and $1 billion in trades" today!!   Does this mean I have to start calling you "Mr. John"?! It was great to see you're doing so well....
