How about drinks at 5:30 on Thursday.   I try not to interrupt work with  personal business. John - I completely understand your point of view.  PaineWebber knows affluent investors such as yourself want access to alternative investments such as private equity and hedge funds.  Our group has also found that high net worth individuals prefer a consultative relationship where we help you structure a complete asset allocation based on your objectives.  We then provide you with access to, and help you select, third-party institutional money managers to make the day-to-day investment decisions.  We also provide the ongoing performance monitoring of those managers, including correlations to the appropriate indices. I believe you will find our approach to be appreciably different from your previous contacts with financial advisors, where you have felt the advisor was 'pushing' a house fund or stock du jour.  If your schedule permits, I would like to meet with you on Thursday afternoon to discuss this in more - Mike John - We'll get the paperwork together and sent to you for naked options.  At some point, I'd like to talk about the diversification strategy in more detail -- perhaps over dinner or a quick meeting after the markets close?

Of course, you would then be in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce.  I'm not interested.
