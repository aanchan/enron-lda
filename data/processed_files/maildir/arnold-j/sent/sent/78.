not me Never mind.  Did you do that? Brian T. Hoskins Enron Broadband Services 713-853-0380 (office) 713-412-3667 (mobile) 713-646-5745 (fax) All, Sorry for the lengthy thread.  A service request has been opened with  Microsoft on the IE5 issues and her application. Regards, -jkc John Cheng Brian, I apologize if I didn't make myself clear over the phone.  There is a process  that we must follow for software upgrades to ensure compatibility with  existing applications and supportability for the helpdesk staff, even if it  is for a small subset of the population.  Furthermore, all applications must  be packaged by Application Integration before it gets rolled out to the  desktops.  As you can see, it is more than dispatching desktop support to  install the application itself. Have you guys look at other technologies such as NetMeeting?  It is installed  with IE5 and provides real time chat. I don't mean to be a pain in the neck, but I must advise against IE5.5 at  this time. Regards, -jkc John, I talked to Fangming, and unfortunately, her program is not compatible with  IE 5.0.  Let's proceed with the installation of IE 5.5.  This is an extremely  important program that all of the traders will be using.  If you need  additional resources, I can arrange for this.  Just let me know what you  need.   These are the people we need to set up with the upgraded version. Thanks, Brian
