Thanks.  This is a project we should have done 5 years ago. John Futures' information - will work with Dutch, may take several days Margin Financing Agreement terms: Warren Tashnek left me a message today saying that the Soc Gen documents were  coming.   Sarah: Can you create a spreadsheet summarizing Enron's open futures interest broken  down by commodity and broker, including maintenance and initial margin for  all commodities (including rates, currencies, gas, crude, etc).   Also, can you create a list of all margin financing agreements in place and  the rates we pay. Thanks, John
