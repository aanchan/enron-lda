And I'm expecting the same from you. Brian Hoskins John, I trust you have set a good example for all of us to follow by contributing  20% of your gross income.  Don't let us down. Brian John Arnold Dear fellows, Please remember to fill out your pledge card for United Way (even if you  don't plan on contributing)  if you haven't done so thus far. Thanks, John
