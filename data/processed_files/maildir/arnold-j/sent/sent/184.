John and Tim -- I believe this one is for both of you.  Thanks. Eric cc: I work for the Airport Authority for Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in Seattle, Washington and I am responsible for Managing the Utilities. We are interested in hedging our Electricity and Natural Gas supplies. Can I get some information on Enron's services in this area? Douglas C.
