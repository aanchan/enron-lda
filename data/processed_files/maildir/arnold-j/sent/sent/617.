i think jv strip prices to where we price out enough demand to get to 2.8.   whther that price level is 425 or 725 is arguable.  i think it's close to  here.  but when we get to november and we have 2.8 and don;'t repeat the  weather of this past winter and we have 2.5 bcf more supply and people  realize that we have 2.3 bcf to withdraw before there are any  problems...bombs away.   Why do you think nov mar is worth $3.75?  beverage?
