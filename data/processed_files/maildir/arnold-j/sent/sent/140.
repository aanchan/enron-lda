Yea ... the later the better. Fangming, I am out of town until tomorrow so will not be able to see the demo today.   Wednesday afternoon looks good for me if you'd like to do it then.

I am planning to take vacation on Friday and coming Monday. I will not be available to show you the demo until next Wednesday if you can't see it today. Let me know your schedule. Thanks, Fangming
