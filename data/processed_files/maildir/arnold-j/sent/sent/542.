maybe.  hydro situation dire in west.  think water levels are at recent  historical lows.  problem is from gas standpoint, west is an island right  now.  every molecle that can go there is.  so will provide limited support to  prices in east.  hydro in east is actually very healthy.  would assume your  markets are targeting eastern u.s. so i dont know if hydro problem in west is  that relevant. Sarah Mulholland interesting comment from singapore........ hope things are going well up there. Hans Wong i was reading something interesting last week somewhere on states coping with  the coming summer---the report was on the amount of ice -not huge enough from  this winter to provide enough water for hydroelectricity during  summer.farmers were encouraged to cultivate crops that consume less water-the  first thing i can  think of is low sul fueloil as natgas will be well  supported-thus european lsfo will be arbg to the states.just my  thought-hi/low play worth watching
