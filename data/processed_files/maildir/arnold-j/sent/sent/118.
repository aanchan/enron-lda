Yea, problem is I left at noon to catch my flight, but Marc had a later  flight because NY is closer to Columbus than here. Right after I left, the  market got very busy and Marc decided to stay at work and not go.  So that  sucked. Jennifer Burns I think I would be a little disappointed after traveling so far.......I guess  it was nice to see your "buddies". John Arnold Sounds as if you went to a better show than I did.  The game was very  sloppy.  They tied 0-0.  Not too exciting. Jennifer Burns Well......IT WAS GREAT!!!!!! Live was actually better than Counting Crows  (Shocking).  How was the Soccer Game?  I owe you dinner.  Thanks again for  the tickets. John Arnold how was the concert?
