I suggest that we initially cover this person out of the Portland office.   One of our middle marketers can easily get up to meet with this guy.   Depending on the magnitude and complexity o their power and gas needs are we  will then pull in the appropriate people.  Phillip and John, let me know if  this works for you. John and Tim -- I believe this one is for both of you.  Thanks.
