Oops, I hadn't gotten to this one yet.  Can we do it any later? Let's plan on meeting between 3 and 3:30pm on Wednesday.  I'll call you on  Wednesday. Brian T.

Right now only you and myself have been added into the NT group. After the demo, if both of you think it is a great tool, then I am going to add all traders into the NT group, so they can use it.
