Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement Debra, I thought I would touch base with you on the status of the Material Adverse Change language for the above agreement.  I did speak with Marie Heard yesterday and she indicated she would contact you concerning this language. Marie advised that even though this language was approved for the Bandwidth agreement, it would not necessarily be approved for this gas agreement. This particular language needed special approval from our CFO as it differs from our "approved" language.  In light of that, I am sending you our standard language in case the "bandwidth" version is not acceptable to Enron's gas Credit people. We are very anxious to finalize this agreement, so please let me know if there is anything I can do from our side to expedite this.  I really appreciate all of your assistance!       <<Material Adverse Change.doc Kathleen Dirks Contract Administrator Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation 1100 Walnut Street, MS 29-2918 Kansas City, MO  64119 Phone: 816-527-1560 Fax: 816-527-4560  - Material Adverse Change.doc << File: Material Adverse Change.doc
