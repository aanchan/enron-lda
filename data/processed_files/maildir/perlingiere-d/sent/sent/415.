Cause: Office keeps a directory full of shortcuts to recently opened files.   As this directory gets larger, the problem starts to occur. Resolution: Delete the h:\application data\microsoft\office\recent  directory.  It will be re-created when the next file is saved.  Note: This is  a workaround, as this directory will re-populate itself over time and the  problem will resurface.  A long-term solution is being researched.
