Please see comments regading Thresholds and advise as soon as possible. Thanks Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp. Legal Department 1400 Smith Street, EB 3885 Houston, Texas 77002 Phone 713-853-7658 Fax  713-646-3490 		  Hi Debra, Have you had any word back from credit regarding the Exposure Thresholds? When last we spoke, Enron wanted Duke to be reduced to $1M regarding Early Termination Damages due to current exposure rates.  Our credit department came back and said the Enron's exposure to Duke was such that they would then want to see an equal reduction in Enron's Early Termination Damges amount. Basically, our credit department has asked that these amounts be reciprocal in nature as we have a situation where our exposure to one another is almost equal. Please let me know what they say. Robin
