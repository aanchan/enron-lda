I will prepare this draft.     	 	 	                            	 I have attached a worksheet for a master physical for one of Nelson Ferries'  counterparties.  He is visiting the counterparty next week and has requested  that the draft contract be delivered to him by the end of this week.  Sorry  for the rush job.  Please let me know if I can do anything else from here.   If you have any questions, give me a shout. Thanks, John
