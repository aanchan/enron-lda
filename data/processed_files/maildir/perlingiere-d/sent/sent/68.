Connie Sutton  Here is the list of the top 40 with the information pertaining to deals and  activities. I have made a recommendation of what type of contract or to  terminate contracts.  I will be out until April 14th. Hopefully by then you  will be able to get some of the Enfolio's and GISB's out and credit will be  able to supply to you the final sheets you are missing.
