Please give me some information regarding the gas contracts referenced in  your e-mail. Are you working with Brant Reves in credit?  I am unclear as to  the "gas contracts". Thanks!

Credit says we have a $100MM guarantee from  this company guaranteeing their entities including the one named in the  guaranty. 		       Attached for your review is a guaranty agreement from Aquila Energy. Please let me know if this is acceptable.  Also, gas contracts are ready for execution, will you be initialling them  prior to execution?      Thanks.                     (See attached file: Aquilaguar.doc)  - Aquilaguar.doc
