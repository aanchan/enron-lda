In response to your e-mail please see the attached draft sent to Trans  Canada.  Be advised Trans Canada was less than eager to negotiate this  agreement and as of today there has been no action.   It would be great to  get both  executed!! Debra Perlingiere Enron North America Corp. Legal Department 1400 Smith Street, EB 3885 Houston, Texas 77002 Phone 713-853-7658 Fax  713-646-3490 		  Energy Marketing USA, Inc. Christy, I am going to speak with Debra Perlingiere in ENA Legal to obtain  the most recent version of the Master between ENA and Transcanada Energy  Marketing USA, Inc. and will forward it when I receive it.  I also will check  into the status of that unexecuted Master as it may be that we can assist in  getting both executed at the same time.  Thanks. Energy Marketing USA, Inc. Christy, attached please find the Master Purchase and Sale Information  Worksheet for TransCanada Energy Marketing USA, Inc. Please note that Russell Diamond and Veronica Espinoza have been working on  executing a Master Purchase and Sale Agreement with the same counterparty on  behalf of ENA.  I have based the EES Master Worksheet off of the ENA Master  Worksheet to remain consistent.  My understanding from talking with Veronica  and Russell is that this Master is not yet executed. In negotiating the ENA Master, a $60MM Enron Corp. guarantee has been issued  benefiting TransCanada Energy USA, Inc.  In addition, TransCanada Pipelines  Ltd. has issued Enron and any of its subsidiaries a $60MM guarantee on behalf  of its sub, TransCanada Energy USA, Inc.   Putting in place an executed Master is definitely the only way to go as it  will allow us to net exposures between EES and the counterparty.  Please let  me know how the status of the Master progresses or if you need my assistance  to facilitate.  Thanks for your help.  << File: TransCanada Energy Marketing USA, Inc. Master Worksheet.xls
