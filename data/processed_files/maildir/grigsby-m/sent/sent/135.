Matt,   Please take a look at these spreadsheets and calc the gas usage by plant and  by pipe in CA.  Chris Foster is telling us that most of these palnts will be  shutting down in the next few weeks due to credit exposure.  Let's discuss  the impact on sendouts. Thanks, Grigsby     	 	 	 Philip is a list of the gas plants.  CEC list is all plants including QFs and  non QFs (i.e.utility plants and the IPPs - Reliant, SOuthern et al).   Chris
