Patti, will you please review each of the SW Gas deals on this spreadsheet  and let me know which deals they penalized us for?  We are looking to see if  they have been penalizing multiple deals or one deal in particular.  They  claim that all one month deals fall under an IT contract that cannot be  penalized.  I want to make certain that they did not penalize one month deals. Thanks, mike     	Enron North America Corp.
