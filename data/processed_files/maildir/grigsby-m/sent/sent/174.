This is the data that we will use to build our Socal growth estimates.   Take  a look at the file and then we can discuss how to combine this with current  pipeline capacity and future expansions. Mike     	 	 	 Kristian J Lande As noted in my  last e-mail, the Ray Nixon expansion project in Colorado had  the incorrect start date.  My last report showed an online date of May 2001;  the actual anticipated online date is May 2003.   The following list ranks the quality and quantity of information that I have  access to in the WSCC:  1) CA - siting office, plant contacts  2) PNW - siting offices, plant contacts  3) DSW - plant contacts, 1 siting office for Maricopa County Arizona.  4) Colorado - Integrated Resource Plan If anyone has additional information regarding new generation in the Desert  Southwest or Colorado, such as plant phone numbers or contacts, I would  greatly appreciate receiving this contact information.
