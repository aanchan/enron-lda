pls remind me of this.  thanks df Steve Welch As of September 29th if you have not converted from the "old" ras dial-up  connection to ipass you will no longer be able to dial into Enron from your  laptop. This will not effect those that dial in with their "home" computer. I  need your laptop and the following information,,, RC#, last four numbers of  your SS, and the company number. The process takes about one hour to load the  software and test the dial-up connection. We need your info now so we can get  the account setup, so that when you bring your laptop to me all I have to do  is load the software and test. Have a great weekend......Steve Welch...
