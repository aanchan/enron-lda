    	 	 	 Drew -  Attached are the latest drafts of the Northern and Transwestern budget  templates for your review and comment.  Changes were made to legal fees for  both cost centers as per my notes from the last group meeting we had on  budget.  In addition, you should have received the latest consolidated budget  run and the latest outside counsel spreadsheet for 2001. Let me know if you have any questions, modifications, concerns, etc. Eric
