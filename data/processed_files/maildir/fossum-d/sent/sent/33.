Lets talk about this tomorrow--obviously this changes the facts somewhat.  DF  Louis Soldano Louis Soldano Louis Soldano I am obviously not y2k complaint.   The agreement does read as Charlie  indicated  ? 2.3  TW shall own, operate and maintain facilities. "...capable of  delivering no less than 200,000 MMBtu of gas per day..." and PG&E facilities  "...capable of receiving no less than 200,000 MMBtu per day...". There are also pressure obligations - a minimum delivery pressure of 600 psig  and a maximum of 700 psig.    otherwise, there are no volume restrictions... Michel Nelson Charlie is doing some more digging, but hasn't found anything in the  operating agreement to limit us to 250/d yet (other than the July or August  99 letter related to '250/d limits until all PCB issues are resolved'..     	 	 	 Mike, At your request I reviewed the June 27, 1995 Operating Agreement between PG&E  and TW looking for any volume commitments and found only the following  reference: ? 2.3  TW shall own, operate and maintain facilities. "...capable of  delivering no less than 200,000 MMBtu of gas per day..." and PG&E facilities  "...capable of receiving no less than 200,000 MMBtu per day...". The Operating Agreement references an Interconnect Agreement between TW and  PG&E dated 3/16/92.  It does not appear that the Operating Agreement canceled  or superseded the Interconnect Agreement.  I am trying to find a copy of that  Interconnect Agreement to see if any quantity language is in it. Vig, do we have a certificate limit regarding the quantity we can deliver to  PG&E at Topock?
