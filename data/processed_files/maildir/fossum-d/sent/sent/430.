That, my man, is the $64 question.  Kim and Rockie are nailing this down  was that if we own it, they want it, and if we don't own it, we'd better not  convey it to them.  Clever devils, they are forcing us to determine exactly  what it is that we own!  Talk to you tomorrow.  DF Louis Soldano Louis Soldano Louis Soldano are we only selling the 12"??? Bob Burleson I am not sure if this piece of pipe was addressed in the last correspondence  or not. There is a 6" lateral pipeline located in Sec. 34-T18S, R36E, Lea County, NM.  If this is part of the deal I will need to see the right-of-way documentation for this pipeline. Sherri Orler  I was in a meeting yesterday and found out that there is a 12" pipeline  located in the SW/4 Sec. 29 and SE/4 Sec. 30, T17S, R32E, Lea County, New  Mexico, that is part of the deal.  It is my understanding that this  pipeline was built by Transwestern a few years ago.  I did not see any  right-of-way agreements to cover this line when I was in your office this  week.  Please provide me with the right-of-way documentation to cover this  pipeline.  If you have any questions, please call me at 281-293-2165.  I would  appreciate receiving this information as soon as possible.  Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!  Sherri Orler  Cc: Chamblee, Chris J.  Attached is a Question Request Form.
