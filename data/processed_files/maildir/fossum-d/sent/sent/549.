pls print and hand to me.  DF       	 	 	 Today, I received a data request (attached) which provides more specifics on  the interviews to be conducted in Omaha. Please note that they have asked to  meet with Keith Petersen and Ray Smith on an individual basis.  If the FERC  deems it necessary, they will interview individuals that report to them.
