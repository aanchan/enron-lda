I'm out the 28th but am glad to discuss today or the 27th if there is  anything else I can add on the subject.  Thanks. dF Susan Scott I'm available. Lorraine Lindberg I thought I'd get the ball rolling and try to get this small group together  next week to begin discussing the idea Drew had about selling the fuel on the  San Juan Lateral to "free up" space which we could sell.  Is everyone  available Thursday 12/28 at 10 am?  Please let me know.  Thanks. Lorraine
