Interesting.  I'll work with MKM and Maria on getting answers to AA's  questions and comments.  I think we can eliminate the specific cross  references between the two agreements, but is that the real problem or is AA  going to choke on our execution of both agreements with the same party?   (that's a tough one to wire around, if it is their real concern).  Thanks.  DF Heather Mueck George - Stan asked that I forward our comments on to you regarding the TW Compression  Services Agreement and the Purchase and Sale Agreement.  If you would like to  discuss, we will be available early next week.  Thanks. Stanley Farmer George Fastuca Stan, attached is the latest draft of the compression services agreement  related to the TW compression monetization effort. Since you've reviewed it  last, nothing material has changed as you can see from the red-lined version.  We would like to file for regulatory approval soon. Pls let me know if you  have any questions - thanks.    I'll send the updated PSA agreement in a separate Email. Maria Pavlou In case you didn't have this old message.  Below is the latest draft of the  Services Agreement.  I will also reforward to you the latest drafts/exhibits  of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.  Thanks, Maria Maria Pavlou Attached is a revised redlined draft of the above-referenced  Agreement which  incorporates comments from regulatory and Mike Bryant with V&E.  We have  added a new Appendix 1 to cover the Assets subject to this Agreement rather  than refer to the Exhibit in the Purchase and Sale, as well as an exclusivity  provision regarding use of the Assets.  We've also added a reference to the  arbitration section in the event the oversight committee cannot agree to  changes necessary or desirable to the assets.
