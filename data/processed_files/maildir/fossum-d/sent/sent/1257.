That's a better idea.  df i think it is best if i continue to spend my time with Phil Lowry's direct  reports on monday morning...i'll start leaving you folks a voice mail on  sunday's if anything is hopping....  If Mike has "checked out", will he then not be here on Monday at 8:30 for  pre-Stan meeting, or what?  Should I just   call Drew?   When?
