Yuck.  I am eager to discuss this with you both.  DF      	 	 	 Ann Ballard There is a discussion of HHI's in a FTC guideline called the 1992 Horizontal  Merger Guideline, which can be found on the FTC's website.  I have tried to  create a hotspot for you here www.ftc.gov.  The discussion of HHI's starts at  1.5. HHI means Herfindahl - Hirschman Index.   Enjoy!
