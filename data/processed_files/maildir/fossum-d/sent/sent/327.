Cool--I'm in Monday--lets talk then.  Thanks. DF John Dushinske Drew - Just wanted to follow up on our discussion on Monday about new  services, especially hourly firm.   As we discussed our team does not see a need to create or offer this service at this time.    However, we did not get a chance to discuss the merits of going forward  anyway to act on the receptivity of FERC to these services.   Please give me  a call or let me know when we can stop by to discuss briefly.  I would like  Tim to participate in the discussion as well.  He is out today meeting w/ GRE and will be back on Friday. Thanks.  John  PS - I could give you a quick update on Hubbard at that time also.
