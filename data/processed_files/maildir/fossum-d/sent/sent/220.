pls print.  thanks df Steven Harris FYI James Centilli Please find attached an explanation of how the $2.8M was negotiated from Dave  Foti and myself.  The other file attached is the calculations per the  contracts we executed with ESC and the earnings impact, if we agree with ESC  new one time payment.    The economic benefit  to be derived from this change may or may not be  achieved, because it is dependent on ESC and TW ability to avoid the peak  demand  charge.  ESC has an obligation in the contract to assist TW in  developing a system to monitor and avoid the peak demand charge.  If ESC  receives this benefit in  the one time payment, TW may lose any leverage we  have.  The demand payment includes full payment of these peak demand charges  with ESC rebating the   cost on a monthly basis, if these charges are avoided.  If we need to develop our negotiating strategy before we meet with ESC on  Wednesday, please advise.    Dave Foti & James Centilli
