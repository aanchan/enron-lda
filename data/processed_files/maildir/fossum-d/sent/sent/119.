This shouldn't impact ET&S since it is limited to Louisiana, but I've routed  it to our commercial people for a quick double check.  If you don't hear from  me by Monday, ET&S is OK.  Thanks.  DF Louis Soldano Louis Soldano Louis Soldano drew - i cna't imagine this would affect nng or tw but they did not have your  name on the list of distribuion under northern so you might not have seen  this... Michael Moran Please see the attached and let me know if you have any problems so that GPG  can respond to Brian Redmond. Please find the attached memo summarizing a proposed joint venture between  Enron North America and Texaco involving our respective intrastate pipeline  assets in Louisiana (i.e., Enron's LRC pipeline).  The joint venture would  restrict Enron and its affiliates from pursuing certain limited business  opportunities involving specified pipeline assets that may be competitive  with the joint venture.  Specifically, these assets include:  (i) the Acadian Gas Pipeline System (currently ultimately owned by Shell  Petroleum Inc. USA),  (ii) the Cypress Gas Pipeline System (currently ultimately owned by Shell  Petroleum Inc. USA),  (iii) the Louisiana Intrastate Gas System (currently ultimately owned by  American Electric Power Co. Inc.),  (iv) the Louisiana Gas System (currently ultimately owned by Conoco Inc.);  and  (v) the Louisiana gas pipeline assets of Koch Gateway Pipeline Co. (currently  ultimately owned by Koch Industries).   In keeping with Enron's internal policies, we are seeking your confirmation  that you have no objection to the non-compete provisions in this  transaction.  Please feel free to call Lance Schuler, Hal Bertram or me if  you have any questions. Regards, Brian
