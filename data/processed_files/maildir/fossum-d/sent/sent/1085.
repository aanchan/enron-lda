I don't see any serious problems with this.  There are a few things you two  need to verify or get comfortable with:  bullet 6 says PG&E has made all  payments in a timely manner.  You can leave it in if its true, but the bullet  needs to be mutual, not one-way, and I'd suggest replacing it with:  "Transwestern and PG&E agree that, by entering into this agreement, neither  is to be deemed to have made any admission against interest."  Also, the  mechanism in bullet 9 is up to you, Paul.  We should probably list the rating  service by name to avoid ambiguity.  There are also a couple of minor  things:  in bullet 2, add an "s" to "contract" inline 2; in bullet 7, add  "the" at the end of line 1.  Call if you have questions.  DF     	 	 	  I have received the comments from PG & E. They are in a red lined version in  the attached file below.  Please review and let's discuss.  Thanks. Paul, Here's PGE revision to the proposed document. Good to know that you have received wire transfer in time.
