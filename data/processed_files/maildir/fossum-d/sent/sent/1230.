That is unclear at this time--I'll consider this and as I'm not moving for  awhile, this may be the easy fix.  Thanks. df Will someone residing outside of Texas be replacing you as general counsel of  NNG?  If so, then that person could replace you. Drew, Will you be moving to Houston soon?  I guess that when you do relocate  we should find a substitute for you on the OPI director and officer slate. I have cc: Melinda Winn on this e:mail because she is handling legal matters  for the tax group now, and would handle the election of a replacement for you.
