pls print--I'm sending you several docs on ECS--please give me in one stack.   DF Steven Harris FYI, for our meeting. James Centilli We did not document the up front payments, because of Regulatory concerns.   FERC requested copies of the contracts that defined the payment for  electricity.  The $500k was negotiated in a meeting with George Fastuca and  Mark Courtney, where Mark agreed to share his profit.  We had worked very  closely with them to assure the officer group, how this project compared to  doing it with out ESC.  They never advised Dave Foti or myself of this  change.  The calculations for the up front payment was provided by them and  clearly reflects the revenue sharing agreed to by Mark. Rod Hayslett Did we have a contract that was written and spelled out?    If not, (pretty  sloppy business practice), then we are just going to have to tell Bill Cordes  that we didn't have a deal, and someone is going to have to suck it in to  make up the $500K.    If we did, what does the deal say?    David Foti Rod, Steve, & James: In rough terms, this is what I understand ECS' logic to be - The $3.35 per KW for transmission demand charge was assumed not to be  avoidable and have a 5000 KW minimum when ET&S and ECS agreed on the $2.8MM  one time payment. ECS says that they have negotiated to make the transmission demand charge  avoidable with no minimum. $3.35 * 10,000HP / 1.341 = $25k $25k discounted 10 years = $1.9MM 25% of 1.9MM = approx. $500k Original one time payment = $2.8MM less $0.5MM = $2.3MM (the new payment ECS  wants to give ET&S) ECS contends that Fastuca agreed to a 25% sharing of benefits received from  the avoidable demand.  My recollection is that the 25% was used as a  benchmark to estimate ECS' fee but was never established as a firm rule. ECS is supposed to provide us with their own written explanation for the  $500k reduction.  They are also supposed to send us the "re-negotiated" rate  schedule 21 that shows the transmission demand charge becoming avoidable. In any event, whether it is reasonable or not that ECS is due the $500k, it  is reasonable to expect that ET&S would have been notified of this change in  a more timely manner. Dave Foti x.31978
