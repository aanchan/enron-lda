pls talk to Norma and find out what we need to do.  I''ll let the group  know.  df     	 	 	 I will need to have any exception requests for vacation carry over (beyond 40  hours) no later than February 15.  Any request you submit should have  appropriate justification (i.e., what were the extenuating circumstances that  prevented the employee from being able to take his/her vacation during the  year).  Since carry-over reports can no longer be run by Payroll, timekeepers  should be able to access year-end  vacation balances.  If you have any  questions, please let me know.
