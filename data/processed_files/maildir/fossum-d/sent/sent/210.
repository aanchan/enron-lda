Oh great, the knuckleheads at PG&E will get SoCal all spooked.  Good luck.   Thanks.  DF Louis Soldano Louis Soldano Louis Soldano Mr. Campbell and I will meet Dr. Komai from SoCal in the late morning or  early afternoon on the 19th in San Francisco.  After our discussions we will  meet the rest of the group back at the Hyatt.  It is doubtful that Dr. Komai  will have more than a couple of hours of information to share with the group  on the 20th so we might considered targeting a departure time in  mid-afternoon. Dr. Komai related that the PG&E press activity has caused concern at the  management level in SoCal and prompted a new round of rigorous sampling  efforts.
