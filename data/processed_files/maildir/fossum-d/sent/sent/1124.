Carter Phillips is going to have his partner, that noted litigator, the one  and only Phil Nowak, argue the case!  When you gonna be up here on Monday???   Believe it or not, we just received a 25 page cert petition to the Supreme Court filed by Bath Petroleum.  As you will recall, the Second Circuit's decision was an unpublished per curiam order.  Even more remarkable is that Carter  Phillips of Sidlley & Austin signed the petition as counsel of record. I will send a copy to Patty.  We can talk next week about our brief in opposition.
