Danny, I'm resending as I had the same problem Cindy did.  I'll give you a  call later today after I've talked to Harris to discuss the various Gallup  scenarios to make sure you and I are on the same page.   The plan that makes  the most sense in my mind is to ram the 10,000/d  project through asap, with  no firm contracts to preserve our options on a NEWCO structure.  We'll  simultaneously implement a new approach on San Juan fuel transport if  possible and then throw the big expansion into the hopper at FERC in January  as Stan suggested.  I hope that timetable is doable--it all depends on  planning/ops deciding what they want to build and then clearing our financial  hurdles.

We want to expedite these efforts too..  I would like to see an application filed filed by January 31st to get 30 to 50 MMCF/D. Steve Harris and Phil Lowry should have the lead to get this done.  I am willing to construct at risk but want to see the financials as well.
