If we are still talking about 6-1, any time after 1 should work for me, as  I've got a meeting that ends at 11:30 downtown.  How long does it take to  drive to Katy at noon???  About 3 hours?  DF That's the Norman course. Why don't you make a tee time. Pat    afternoon of June 1 works great with me.  I've "inked" you  in.  Drewski,    plan to stay at the house that evening as well.  same for  you David Hill if    you can make it.    no, but would love to here the story.         How about Thursday or Friday, June 1 or 2 for a round of  golf?  I'm in    HOU     all wk and the end of the wk looks pretty light.  I'd be  happy to venture     out west to your Katy/San Antonio nick of the woods if you  guys are     available.  Hill, are you gonna be in Houston around then?  If so, can    you     sneak the clubs past your wife?  Please advise.  DF         PS:  I met with Paul Bieniawski and his new storage group  today.  Do you     guys know how he parted terms with the Frogs?
