I'll be out on the 2d.  I'll have Maria participate and pass anything on that  is of particular concern.  Thanks df Dorothy McCoppin Will we have a meeting on Jan. 2 in your office (pre-ETS staff meeting)?   If so, will it be at 8:30 or can it be 9:00 am? --Dot Stanley Horton This is to advise you that we will NOT have ETS Monday morning staff meetings  on December 18 or December 25.
