I don't see anything controversial in Leslie's outline.  We've done  a lot of  thinking about Dynegy's "funny money" argument and I volunteer Maria to work  with you and Leslie on making sure ENA's comments are consistent with ours on  this and all related issues.  DF   Shelley Corman FYI - Attached are ENA's preliminary thoughts on comments for the marketing  affiliate conference.  They are not certain yet whether they want to sponsor  a participant at the discussion table. Here is a memo on PL00-1.  Shelly, I am sure you will recognize the ideas.   Thanks.
