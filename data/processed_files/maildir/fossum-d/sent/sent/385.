I need to be in DC on Thursday next week, so any time in Denver that allows  me to get to DC is ok.  DF Jeffery Fawcett I got a call at 10:30 a.m. from George Briden indicating that his client's  plans were changed over the weekend and they will not be available to come to  Houston for tomorrow's meeting.  They will be in their Denver offices all  next week and suggested that we might meet up with them there.  Drew has  indicated his willingness to meet with them in Denver next week.      Given this change in events, I'd suggest that we pack-up a small contingent  to go to Denver and meet with them.  I'm thinking Terry or Ron, plus Steve  Harris (if available) and myself.  I don't have any dates/times yet.  I'll  call George and get his thoughts.  Will you EMail me back and let me know  what days/times will work for you next week?  Thanks. Jeffery Fawcett See attached note.  I'm thinking that for a preliminary discussion with this  [potential] customer, we should high grade the meeting as well as limit the  number of meeting participants to no more than 5-6 from our side.  Bear in  mind that Drew has a relationship with George Briden already and he will be  here in Houston for this meeting.  In addition to Drew, I'd like to see  representatives from TW Commercial, marketing services, and facility  planning/engineering involved.  If you feel I've missed a function here that  should be included, please advise.  Let me know your availability and/or the  availability of your designee.   Audrey, will you secure a conference room for us on that date/time:  1:30 -  3:30 p.m, Tues. July 11th.   Plan on about 8 people.  Can we get a  coffee/soft drink/snack set-up also?  Thanks. Jeffery Fawcett George, Thanks.  Let's plan on about 1:30 p.m. CDT on July 11th here in Houston at  Transwestern's office in the Enron Building at 1400 Smith Street.  Just check  in at the security desk, ask for me and they'll direct you to the elevators  leading to our (41st) floor.  I don't think we'll need the whole afternoon,  particularly at this stage, but I'll plan on at least a couple of hours.   I'll ask a couple of reps from our engineering/operations group to join us  and be prepared to answer questions about TW, its operation, as well as the  estimate and underlying engineering of the lateral pipeline.  I'll forward  this to Drew so that he can make his arrangements to join us also. I look forward to meeting you and your client in person.  Call me if you have  any questions. Jeff; We (Larry Carpenter and I) will be there afternoon of the 11th.  We have Tell me where you want us to be. GB  George,  Drew said he'd be available here in Houston either the afternoon of the  11th or the morning of the 12th.  If you could check with your clients and  get back to me on their availability at these date/times that would be  great.  Thanks.
