Lindy, if all FERC wanted is  a list and contacts, this looks fine.  If they  wanted exact MDQ and usage numbers for each customer, let me know.  DF       	 	 	 Not having received the request,  it seems like the quantity related to the  contract would provide them better info than a contact name and phone  number-  did they specifically ask for that inf0??  upon answer, work  directly with Drew as I'll be out.   MK Lindy Donoho Please see my original message below.  Are you okay with TW forwarding this  info to FERC? Steven Harris Maybe you should ask Drew or Mary K. Lindy Donoho In response to a request of Steve January from FERC, I've put together a list  of Transwestern's "major" shippers to California with contact names and phone  numbers.  I've defined "major" as anyone with total firm contracts of  25,000/d or more.  Please see the attached list.  Is everyone okay with me  passing this along to Ray Montini at FERC? Let me know if it's okay to go or if I need to run this by anyone else before  sending it out. Thanks, Lindy
