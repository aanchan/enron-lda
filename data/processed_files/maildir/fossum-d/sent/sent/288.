Team I have summarized in the margins of our DRAFT deal structure the "high level"  issues that Gail Tholen, Jin and I discussed on Thursday.   These are  preliminary guidelines and as our deal evolves and our partner's desires  change, we will have to potentially address completely different accounting,  regulatory and tax issues.     We hope to touch on some of the issues that  this structure may raise from a Regulatory perspective with Drew Fossom when  Please comment and advise as you see fit. Thanks -John
