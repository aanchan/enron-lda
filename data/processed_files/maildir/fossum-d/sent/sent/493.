Lou's right, I probably won't be able to help answer any questions, but I am  happy to offer my insights on how to cut his budget.   DF Louis Soldano Louis Soldano Louis Soldano do we ever end these financial reviews???  i'm on pins and needles waiting to  be "summoned" to expalin the $10 million "Soldano settlement" and i never get  a call.... i'll be in montana on monday...any questions about legal, indian row or  environmental please call drew...he won't be able to help but call him  anyway... legal should be in good shape - just let mike know if anything comes up.    Stan knows the situation on the indian ROW (i asked him how he wanted to show  it in the budget) . i don't think we have issues for environmental but bill  kendrick would be in the best position to answer any questions (sorry  bill)....i'll be in friday morning if you think we need to discuss  anything....thx 	Elaine Concklin 	 REMINDER:  3rd Current Estimate Officer Review for NNG and TW  Monday,  September 11, 2000  EB49C2 / OMA717 Thanks,  Elaine
