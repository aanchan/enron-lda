Ugh.  Do we need to say "from storage inventory" or can we just mention gas  sales?  I seem to recall that we already discussed that and the accountants  wanted to mention the source of the sold gas, but if I'm wrong, lets make the  reference less specific.  Thanks. DF         	 	 	 Here are the paragraphs in the 3QTR 10Q relative to ETS that contain  references to our base gas sales.  We have suggested the change shown to  de-emphasize the fact that there were sales in both years.   Do you want to  suggest any further changes in the next draft we receive for review? Allen Joe Attached are proposed changes to Enron's 10Q for 3rd Qtr 00 on ETS net  revenues section.
