DF Lorna Brennan Drew, I pulled TW San Juan (Blanco) prices off the RDI database for January 1, 1998  through June 8, 2000 (the most current in the database).  If you need to have  the remainder of June and the first part of July input, let me know.  The  file is attached and is saved in Excel so you can edit as needed. Lorna
