pls print.  thanks df Shelley Corman Attached is a draft set of slides and notes for Dave Neubauer's remarks at  the Sept. 19 FERC Technical conference.  The presentation is built around  Dave's outline of the six elements of making pipeline capacity "tradeable"  that he described at the last regulatory roundtable. {Look at powerpoint  presentation in notes view to see the text} As you'll see, we are not  advocating for specific regulatory changes in the  presentation.   Our message is that the Commission does not need to force  segmentation and one-size-fits-all policies to make capacity trading a  reality.   Rather,  some minor adjustments, together with growing industry  acceptance of capacity trading are all that is necessary to make it happen. Dave's Other Panelists: Altra will also be on Dave' panel and will talk about trading (most likely  why their exchange model is superior to EOL).  Jeff Holligan of Amoco will likely speak about the need for forced pipeline  capacity auctions as a means to eliminate marketing affiliate concerns and  the need for standardization to promote liquidity.   Diane McViker of Salt River Project will talk about why pipelines should be  willing to keep supplier records for shippers as part of the recent GISB  cross-contract ranking  Robert Levin of NY Mercantile Exchange will talk about factors that improve  liquidity and whether gas markets are liquid today. Jon Wilems of the Wisc. Distributor group will also speak about greater  commodization of capacity to develop trading of capacity.
