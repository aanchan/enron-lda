I think we can tell Rich yes, but please confirm that for me.  thanks.  DF Drew are we OK to go with this? We don't have any "confidential  transportation-related information in our office. We do have some operating  agreements and contracts but they aren't confidential that I know of.   Rich Drew Fossum EES is a marketing affiliate, so we do need to be careful about shared  computer systems, phone systems, staplers, paper clips, etc.  If Rich and his  office have no "confidential transportation-related information"  we might be  able to do it, otherwise, the hassles and expense of building marketing  affiliate firewalls might make it counterproductive.   I'm forwarding this to  the experts for a quick yup or nope on this.  Thanks. DF   Michel Nelson Rich - Per your phone mail, I see no reason why an EES employee couldn't  office in your Region Office, providing he/she pays rent and we not break any  market affiliate rules (if they apply here). Drew - Saving $ for Enron. Any issues I'm overlooking? Mike
