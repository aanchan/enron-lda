This list looks much better than the other one.  Please make sure that we are  clear with the FERC people that this is a list of AA projects related to CWIP  and not a list of everything under the sun that AA does for us.  I want to  avoid any appearance that we misled the FERC people.  Thanks. DF  Lee Huber Here is the pared down project report from AA that we will send to FERC.       	 	 	 Here's the list, which is limited to CWIP, that we would send to the FERC  auditors.  I'll await Drew's OK before sending. Thanks, Gary. Heather Mueck Gary - Revised to include SAP projects related to property.  Let me know if you have  any changes. Heather
