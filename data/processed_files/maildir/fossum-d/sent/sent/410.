Thanks for the update--Other than the Gallagher Boland $$$ I can't think of  anything that we might be squirreling away and capitalizing.  (Grynberg $$ go  to a work order also, but are expensed, right?).  Also, I absolutely trust  you, but in the Ronald Reagan sense:  "Trust, but verify."  Adios.  DF   Louis Soldano Louis Soldano Louis Soldano DREW - SINCE I DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON I SPOKE WITH ELAINE.    WE HAVE CAPITAL CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC PROJECTS - SUCH AS AN  EXPANSION PROJECT.  I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE ANY OF THOSE AND I HAVE PROVIDED  MS. PATEL A LIST OF ET&S PROJECTS THAT FIT IN THIS CATEGORY (I ONLY HAD A  COUPLE AS WELL). THERE COULD BE OTHER CHARGES WHICH ARE ALLOCATED TO A GENERAL OVERHEAD AND  CAPITALIZED.  THE ONLY MATTER THAT MIGHT FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY WOULD BE THE  GALLAGHER/BOLAND (OUTSIDE COUNSEL) COSTS.  WE HAVE THESE GOING TO A WORK  ELAINE - ANYTHING TO ADD?  ALSO, I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE COLLECTING THESE  CHARGES FROM ALL GROUPS AND WILL GET BACK TO US??  (AND YOU WILL PUT ME ON  YOUR DISTRIBUTION LIST SINCE I DON'T TRUST DREW AND HE'S TOO SMART TO TRUST  ME.) THX.       	 	 	 Any need to do anything?  DF 	Elaine Concklin 	 Just a reminder for those of you that have not sent me your Overhead  Analysis.  Please send it as soon as possible.  A big thanks to those of you  who have already sent me your information. Please call me at x3-5521 if you have questions. Thanks!  Elaine Bill Cordes
