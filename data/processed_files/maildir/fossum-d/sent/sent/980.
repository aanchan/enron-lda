Nice thought,  but Lay spiked the Treasury rumor right after I started it.   Bummer, that bag boy job would have been a lot of fun.  And to think I  started out as Dave Hooker's bag boy!!!  DF Ken will likely require professional counsel as Sec. Treas. Could be an opportunity for the Fossum's to return to the toilet bowl, I mean DC, as Ken's bag boy. cc: I trust you guys saw this on the wires today: Enron's stock was off $3-3/16 or 4.1 percent in afternoon trading at $74, following an announcement that Jeff Skilling will become its new chief executive officer on Feb. 12. An analyst, who asked not to be named, said that it had been widely assumed that Drew Fossum would be named CEO; therefore, the company's stock traded lower on the news.
