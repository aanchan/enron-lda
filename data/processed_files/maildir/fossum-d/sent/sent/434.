I'm ok with the change.  Just curious, but Courtney doesn't get any  time  value of money recognition on his prepayment?  Also, the prepayment gives us  a cash, but not earnings, benefit, right?  Thanks.  DF James Centilli Susan Bob Chandler and I request some changes inorder to detail the upfront  payment.  If you do not have any problems with the document, please advise  and we will notify Gerald to create executables. Thanks, James Attached is the letter.  I am forwarding per Mark's request.  Let me know if  you have any comments.  If everything looks good, let me know and I will  create executables.  Thanks.
