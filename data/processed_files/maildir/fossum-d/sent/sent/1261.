Lou--could you cover the Derrick meeting on the 12th if Dot is stuck on a  hanging jury?    Again, I expect to be on the phone from Cal., but would like  one of you guys on also in Houston in case of telecom screwups (which follow  me whereever I go).  Thanks.  df  Drew-   Staff meeting on Monday the 9th -- no problem.  I would be glad to cover the  Derrick meeting on April 12; however,   I have jury duty that day (yuck)!  --Dot  If Mike has "checked out", will he then not be here on Monday at 8:30 for  pre-Stan meeting, or what?  Should I just   call Drew?   When?
