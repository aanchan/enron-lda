Is that point the receipt point Sempra would have to use to take the base gas  volumes away from Cunningham?  Thanks.  DF     	 	 	 Linda Trevino If someone tries to nominate POI 61243 they will receive a message saying  "Invalid point".  The market service rep will then notify me because they  cannot nominate on the point.  I will then notify Jan.  Jan and I will notify  Sue, Morgan, Kent and yourself.  Let me know if we need to change anything. Linda     	 	 	 Jan and  Linda, the issue is how does anyone know for last years base gas  deal if it has "gone physical" (if Sempra nominates the SF agreement for  delivery).  My answer subject to your verification is that the POI that they  have to nominate to is flagged as not available, so when they nominate Market  Services is aware of it and is to call Kent/Sue/Morgan.  Could you fill in  any missing details.  Thanks, Dari     	 	 	 They nominate the SF to market services also, in addition to any transport  they have?  Dari, please follow up on this with market services and verify  what the procedures are and let us all know.    Again, this may relate to a  counterproposal we make to TCEM if they barf on the corporate guarantee  issue, so time is of the essence.  Thanks.  DF addition to my first reply: Also, Sempra does not nominate to Kent/Sue/Morgan.  They nominate to Market  Services.  Sempra's scheduler would not even think to call any one of us.  We  would only hope their deal maker, David Otte, would be in the loop on their  side and notify one of us if they ever decided to go physical. Sue
