Pls print up a full copy for Mike and I.  Thanks DF Shelley Corman FYI.  Attached is a copy of the Project Why status presentation that will be  made next week at Stan's May 9 staff meeting.  The purpose of the  presentation was to present a list of brainstorming ideas from an Apr. 16  offsite session to GPG management & get some preliminary feedback on the  kinds of ideas they would like to see proceed.  It was never meant to be a  definitive plan for implementing those ideas.  I always envisioned the  individual commercial groups picking up on which ideas they liked and wanted  to implement & developing their own detailed plans for implementing.   Shelley Corman Attached is a current draft of the Project Why Presentation.    The first set of slides includes the overview, an explanation that the  presentation focueses in on only a few of the ideas, the electronic  contracting presentation, the team 2 real time invoice vision, and team 3's  auction thoughts. Next in the package would be team 3's knowledge call center concept Last but not least would be the Team 4 Internet/Intranet concept
