I guess this is good news unless they introduce the "next steps" section at  the meeting with a slide that is titled "Step One:  Shutting Your Sorry-Ass  Pipeline Down ONce and For All" .   Seriously, the agenda doesn't seem to  have any flavor of escalation, which is great given the  lack of attractive  alternatives for our team right now.  Talk to you about this tomorrow.  DF Louis Soldano Louis Soldano Louis Soldano Guys - just fyi.   Ignore the notes and see the agenda.  nothing surp[rising  so far.. Rich, Attached is a draft agenda for our July 13 meeting. Most of us will be staying the night of 7/12 at the Holiday Inn in Flagstaff.  Your directions look pretty clear but if you could send me via e-mail or fax (415-973-6112) a map that would help keep us from getting lost. thanks,  <<twpcb41.doc rod  cc:  Rod  Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks,  rod   cc:         I understand you will be coordinating the meeting we scheduled for July  13   in Flagstaff.  I anticipate PG&E will have about 7 individuals  attending,   depending if we invite our attorneys.     I would suggest we get started early in the morning of the 13.  We will  be   arriving the night before so an early start will allow us greater   flexibility on getting home that afternoon.  I am in the process of   reviewing our alternatives for getting in and out of Flagstaff.     Let me know what your tentative plans our.     Thanks,     Rod Boschee          - twpcb41.doc
