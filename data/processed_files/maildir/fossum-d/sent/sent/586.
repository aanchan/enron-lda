I'm good with Maria's changes.  Thanks both.  DF Maria Pavlou I made a few revisions.  Pls. call me if you have any questions.  thanks,  Maria Steve Kirk Tony is on vacation today.  Please review asap.  Thanks. Steve Kirk Tony, I need your review and approval asap for the attached E.Dubuque  delivery products that are "daily" in nature (one is for receipt at Ventura  and the other is for receipt at Demarc).  The rate aspect is the same  language as the one-part rates we have already used (designated as "R+C).   This "Dly" designation means that the term is one day which will be rolled  over day-to-day unless either party cancels the rollover.  The term language  shown here is the same as the "daily" language we have been using.  Call me  with your questions. Thanks. x7067.
