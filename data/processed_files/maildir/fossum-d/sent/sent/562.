Sorry, my form file is bare on that topic.  DF Susan Scott I've been asked to draft an agreement with "exclusive dealing" language;  i.e., Transwestern won't talk to anyone but Red Cedar about jointly  purchasing Pipeline X, and vice versa.  If you have any examples, or know  someone who might, let me know.  Many thanks.
