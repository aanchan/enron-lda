Colleen has some useful expertise because of her work on the Clifton Machine  Shop project (i.e., setting up a new business entity within the ETS  organization).  Tony and Lee have some time if Colleen's plate is full.   Either one of them, relying on Colleen for "best practices" input as needed,  might be a good team.  DF Michael Moran Can you give me your thoughts on who from legal should be involved. Rod Hayslett We will also need someone from legal working on the structure/deals. Mike:    Who should we be adding to the group looking at this stuff? Caroline Barnes I would like to get someone from the Financial Review team involved with this  project as it is getting off the ground on how one would financially  structure such a "business".  I do not want this to get too far along without  this type of input so that if and when it is presented for approval all  financial i's and t's have been dotted and crossed.  Who would this be in  your group?   Thanks...cvb Michael Sullivan Attached is beginning information on a recommended ASP scenario.  Please  provide input and feedback.  Thanks
