Susan, MKM's got some good questions about this.  I'm still nervous as a cat  know about the scheduling priority and how it has changed now that this is an  LFT deal.  DF  Mary Kay Miller We really do need to understand the scheduling of this,  if alternates  haven't been scheduled, IT are and now an LFT---  seems a little  questionable, so we need to understand the answer.  Also without knowing the  receipt point how do we know the deal can be done as LFT??  MK Mary Darveaux I forgot to add that this is an LFT. Mary Darveaux Alas- a negotiated Rate Filing with a few days notice!!!! TK has done it again  Negotiated Rate deal with Sempra    December 1 thru December 31    Rate $1.00    10,000/day    Delivery Point  PG&E Topock I will prepare the filing for November 30th.
