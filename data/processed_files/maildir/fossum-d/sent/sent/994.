I have been typing in his name and letting the computer address it.  I've now  the trick.  Thanks!  DF Julie Armstrong   Drew: Thank you for your note.  I saw an email in Danny's box yesterday from you  with the same return mail, host unknown... Do you have Danny listed in personal address book?   We experienced some past  issues with his email address but, resolved it with new email address,  Are you selecting from the address books or typing in his name.  Please  advise and I will look into the issue. I will leave Danny a voice mail message and have forwarded your message to  him.  It is currently in his email box.       	 	 	 Julie--pls forward to Danny.  I've had trouble the last couple of days  getting emails to go through to him.  Am I doing something wrong?

If any of his ideas require regulatory approval we will probably want to include in the same certificate application.
