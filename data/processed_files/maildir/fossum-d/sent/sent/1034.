No concerns--I think we ought to go.  Thanks.  DF     	 	 	 For your info-  any concern with us attending? We could get some good  intelligence in how FERC is feeling about these quality issues.  MK Nancy Bagot Lisa, as the pipelines are very interested, I will be covering Monday's  technical conference on the Producers' petition for a temporary restraining  order to prevent SoNat from shutting in natural gas supply upstream of the  Toca processing plants in Louisiana.   I am happy to send you a copy of my summary of that conference.  If you have  particular interests outside of the general legal arguments and Staff  position, let me know and I will listen for your issues as well. -Nancy
