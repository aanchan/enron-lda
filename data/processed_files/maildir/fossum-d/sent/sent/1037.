pls check for me .  thanks. df Susan Scott Has anyone checked on whether there are any IT contracts and if so what the  contract # is?   If not, I will...just let me know. Drew Fossum Attached is a draft letter requesting that PG&E provide Transwestern with  assurance of creditworthiness under Section 13 of TW's tariff.  Shelley and  Mike have reviewed this already and wanted to get input from the rest of you  as soon as possible.  Note that there are a couple of questions for us to  answer before we send it out.  I would like to  have this ready for Shelley  and Rod to run by Rick Buy, Steve Kean, and others as necessary by COB.   Thanks.  DF
