Any concerns? The EOL help desk received a call from Isabelle Ealet at J Aron in London  (0171 774 2103).  She was asking them why she could not trade with her id and  password that she had been given. I called her and explained that she could not use a Guest Id to trade and  told her that she needed to send in a UK PA (explained to her the location of  the form on the web site).  She said she would send one to us. Then she told me that it was not a problem anyway because she called her New  York office and asked them to give her and id - they set her up as a sub  user.  She then told me that she transacted a deal in London for EN590.  I  told her that her PA would not cover this and I am not sure she understood  this ? Therefore she will have transacted in London under a US PA - correct ?   Please advise as to how we are to deal with this. Thanks Arfan
