I think it's a good idea since the provisional application is on file -  Travis is the internal lawyer who has taken care of the patent application so  he will have better ideas for where the words should be placed and  appropriate look and feel (I would guess near the copyright notice and  roughly equivalent size). 		  Mark, We are thinking of adding a Patent Pending message to key EnronOnline pages  (like the homepage). Can you offer comments/concerns/guidelines? Dave
