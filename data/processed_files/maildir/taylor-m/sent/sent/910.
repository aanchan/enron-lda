Yes, this is fine with me. Sheri L Cromwell Mark, Leslie would like to upgrade her computer with your approval.  Thank you. sc JANETTE  ELBERTSON         Sheri, you need to get the RC Owner to whom she reports to approve this (via  e-mail) before I can order it.   Thanks.  Sheri L Cromwell Hansen's computer as soon as possible: Co. #413, RC #1157 EB 3847 (Ext. 3-6121) PC Serial #961190  (Laptop scheduled to be moved from EB 3890 to EB 3847) Since Leslie will be working from home during part of March, a move request  has been made to replace Leslie's current equipment with the lap top located  at EB3890.  The upgrade needs to be made to the lap top so she can run Live  Link, and other necessary applications.   Please let me know if you need any additional information.  Thank you! sc
