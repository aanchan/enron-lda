my comments made below =20 David Forster g=20 with companies on the ETA / PA changes Mark, Copy of language I suggested to Edmund to avoid reference to manifest error= . Please let me know what you think. Thanks, Dave 23=20 David Forster g=20 with companies on the ETA / PA changes =20 Edmund, How about this? Please forward to me a copy of whatever you would like to send before you= =20 send it. Thanks, Dave Further to the recent queries you raised concerning the ETA, we can provide= =20 you with the following comfort.  The final sentence of  clause 2(d) prevents a Counterparty from claiming that the ETA has not bee= n=20 duly accepted or an offer has not been validly made  or that a transaction has not been validly entered into solely by virtue o= f=20 the electronic =01&click=018 method of submitting offers or execution.=20 This same principle provides protection to you in that the only binding=20 transactions upon both yourselves and Enron are the ones in  which certain terms have been clicked upon by you and the same terms=20 accepted by Enron through the automated EnronOnline process.  The system is designed to ensure that BOTH PARTIES ARE BOUND BY the terms = of=20 the offer you submit are the only terms=20 which ARE can be accepted by Enron. As a result, there have been no instanc= es=20 in which a customer offered on one set of terms, but Enron  accepted a different set of terms.
