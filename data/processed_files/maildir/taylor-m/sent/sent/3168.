In case you need to know.... 	Louise Kitchen 		  Alan Sommer, Mike Patrick and Bruce Garner have now left Enron Net Works.   Alan has joined Rick Causey's group to run the SAP function and Bruce has  moved into EIM to run their European Operations.  Mike Patrick has moved to  work for Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale's accounting group. Bruce's European group  will report up under Andy and his Houston group will  report up under Greg. Kerry Roper, as you know, has already joined to replace Mike. We wish them all the best in their new roles and apologies if I have not  included exactly the right titles for those of you moving on.
