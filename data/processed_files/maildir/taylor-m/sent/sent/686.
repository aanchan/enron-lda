M Index:  Gas Daily WAHA Abbreviation: Waha Sort Code: 3530 The Index for a calendar day shall be the average of the Common High and  Common Low prices published for such calendar day under the heading "Daily  Price Survey" in the Permian Basin Area: Tex intras, Waha area section of Gas  Daily, or if a calendar day is not a Business Day then the price for such  calendar day will be the average of the Common High and Common Low prices  published on the next succeeding Business Day. Should the word "area" after "Waha" be capitalized? On some Gas Daily products we are switching to the Gas Daily posted average -  is this one of those?  Bob Bowen has been looking into this also.
