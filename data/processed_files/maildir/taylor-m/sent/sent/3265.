My guess is this was a holdover from last year's list. 		  It looks like Randy is invited but the rest of South America is not on this  list.  Should she check with John Novak to see if the South American  Attorneys are invited? 	Andrea Calo 		  Sorry to bother you with this, but given the new situation, do you think I am  required to attend this meeting or is it a mailing error.  Thanks. The Enron Wholesale Services 2001 Legal Conference will be held on Thursday  afternoon and Friday, October 11 - 12, 2001 at the Woodlands Resort and  Conference Center north of Houston. Please save the date!
