That's fine with me - we're taking that approach on the "override" letters  that override existing master agreements. Stacy E Dickson Mark,  I am fine with the user not signing.  It is your call though. Stacy David Forster Stacy/Mark, Can we revise the Texas Utilities letter so that the user does not need to  sign, but accepts the amendment by transacting on the website? As we have hordes of customers asking for User ID's, it would be appreciated  if we could land on a final, legal-approved draft of the letter, combined  with a list of affected customers for this morning. Thanks, Dave David Forster 26/11/99 19:31 Stacy, Can we revise the text down to the following? Dear [Customer]: Please be advised that all U.S. physical natural gas transactions that you  enter into with EnronOnline will be with Enron North America Corp. regardless  of anything to the contrary on the website or in any General Terms and  Conditions, if applicable. This leter will be sent with the User ID, so it doesn't really require much  of an introductory sentence. Dave Stacy E Dickson 22/11/99 20:33 Dave,  Attached is the letter that we discussed.  Please give me your comments. Stacy
