Not sure why you weren't on this distribution.... 		  Please find attached a red-lined version of the Asset Purchase Agreement.   Please forward any other comments to me for inclusion before I send this to  ECO's attorneys.  Tommy please pay particular attention to the Excluded  Assets section which Ed and I added software that we understood comprised all  of the third party software.  Also, we have two other questions that we need  for you to clarify.
