If you approve, please forward to  Janette Elbertson so she can place the order.  Thank you!-Becky 	Becky Tlucek 		  Mark, I have researched and provided Brent with information regarding the two  "Enron standard" laptops that are now being utilized.  We have decided on the  Compaq M700 which has a little bigger keyboard (better for  a man's hands)   and weighs a little less than the M300 model.  Please approve this order by  forwarding this message to Janette Elbertson.  Thank you!   Janette: Please order a Compaq M700 Laptop for Brent Hendry.  Charge it to Mark  Taylor's group (Co. 413 / Rc. 1157).  Brent will be here officially the first  week of July but will be "in and out" of the office the last week of June.   If we could have his computer up and running by June 23rd that should cover  it.  Let me know if you need any additional information. Thanks to both of you! -Becky
