In US financial trading (derivatives) we send the attachment each time, but  it should only be 4 or 5 pages long.  This may be different in the physical  trading world - I'll check into it. Louise Kitchen Thoughts? Raphael Brun Thank you  Louise, Just one remark which came back to me already a couple of time. When we close a transaction with our normal counterparties, why do we need to  send the GTC each time since when we close OTC witrh these same  counterparties, this is not necessary ? They are finding that our confirmations are 13 pages long for a single swap.  Do you think we could avoid sending the GTC for some of our most active  counterparties ? Regards Raphael
