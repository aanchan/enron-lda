Francisco - Here is an ISDA that Peggy needs in connection with a project she  is working on in Mexico.  Can you take care of this one?  It looks like it is  a deal-specific agreement for an interest rate swap or swaps.  Sara can  probably fill you in on the kinds of changes from our standard form that  would be ok. 	Peggy Banczak 		  Mark Attached are some comments from Enron's outside counel on the draft ISDA  Master Agreement which I forwarded to you earlier this week. Could you please advise who is reviewing this document and when their review  might be completed. Thank you for your assistance. 		  Attached is the email forwarding the draft swap agt with SG. Rogelio--please take a look at the docs required in Part 3-- some changes  will need to be made I am sure to reflect that EEIM is a Mexican  company--please fax me a markup with your suggested changes.  It looks like  we are going to need Mexican Power of Attorney for CT Corp. for this  agreement also. Carlyn--please look at the CT Corp. appointment letter and let me know if any  hedging agt is contemplated to be included.  We may need a separate  appointment letter for this document (see Part 5, clause (vi)) -- note also  that the jurisdictional consent language is different than in the Loan Agt  and most of the other IDB docs--I don't think we care but I will point it out  to SG--they may want to conform the language to have the same court  jurisdiction. Mike--on substantive issues, please call me when you get back into town and  have a moment to talk.  I spoke with one of my partners in Houston who is  much more familiar with swaps and he thinks it looks ok for the most part--I  have only a few questions/comments for you. Thanks all!
