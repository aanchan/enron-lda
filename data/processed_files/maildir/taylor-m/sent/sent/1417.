Thanks for the resume - I'm looking at a number of internal candidates from  APACHI, CALME and Southern Cone but will keep this one on file (and pass it  along - might be good for Richard Sanders). 	Louise Kitchen 		  Sny interest! This person saw you speak at PowerMart and wanted to see if we had any  available positions within EnronOnline.  He emailed me his resume and  I am  forwarding it on to you.  Don't know if you are interested, but thought I  would send it. adriane  <<Clarence ResumelegalspecRegAff.doc  - Clarence ResumelegalspecRegAff.doc
