John:  Thanks for your note.  Brent Hendry is now our primary weather  derivatives lawyer and I am forwarding this to him. 		  Hi Mark- Attached are the GTC's discussed in my preceding e-mail. Best regards, John 	John Viverito 		  Alan/David- Attached hereto, are the GTC's with Enron Japan Corp. as counterparty for EOL  trading of Japanese weather derivative HDD swaps.  The US GTC's were utilized  as the basis of the documentation.  The GTC's have been tailored to the  Japanese market in conjunction with Baker & McKenzie, Tokyo.   Please review and provide comments prior to loading onto the EOL system.  I  note that September 1, 2000 is the date on which trading on this basis is  expected to begin. Cheers, John
