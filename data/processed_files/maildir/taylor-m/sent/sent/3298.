The next step is for Chad to contact the Credit Group in RAC.  They will do  the credit analysis and send a  credit worksheet to the Swap Group paralegals  who will prepare the first draft, run it by a lawyer and get it ready for the  customer. 		  Mark- As you can see from Chad's e-mail below, Irving Oil is interested in entering  into an ISDA with us.  Please let us know, who will be assigned to prepare  the documentation. Thanks, John John Viverito Phone (713) 345-7814 Fax       (713) 646-3490 	Chad South 		  Per our conversation we have agreed to enter into an ISDA with Irving Oil.   We suggested that Enron originate the documents to expedite the process.   What should be my next step for this?  Thanks. Chad South 31730
