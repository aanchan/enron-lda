How does this process usually start? 	Jeffrey T Hodge 		  Mark: I think this falls in your area. Jeff 		  Jeff:   As we discussed, ENA Upstream Company, LLC will be trading wellhead  gas and will need to hedge its risks with Risk Management Trading ("RMT").    Accordingly, ENA Upstream needs to enter into a Master Swap Agreement with  RMT.   This ENA Upstream/RMT Master Swap Agreement will have term and  conditions similar to the current ENA/RMT Master Swap Agreement.   Would you  please have someone in your group draft the ENA Upstream/RMT Master Swap  Agreement.   ENA Upstream has begun trading and needs to be this agreement in  place as soon as conveniently possible.   Please let me know if you have  questions or need additional information.   Thanks, John.
