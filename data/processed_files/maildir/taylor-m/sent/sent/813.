I haven't had a chance to look at this yet but here it is. Paul Simons Mark As per my voice-mail, here is a raft of GTCs including the US version.  The  US version take on board S &C's comments, but obviously you will need to sign  off on the US GTCs before we go live.  Grateful for any final comments asap  as we are aiming to finalise them on Monday. Many thanks and sorry its not much of a birthday gift (I'll make it up to  you)!
