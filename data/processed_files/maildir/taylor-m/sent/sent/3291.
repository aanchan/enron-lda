		  Although we are still waiting on information from Merrill Lynch, Cliff Baxter  has asked that we make every effort to meet Merrill's deadline (tomorrow) for  relationship reasons.   Thanks for the effort. Bill Tracy Just wanted to let you know that I"ll be working on the physical power side  and Sara Shackleton will be working on the ISDA side of this deal, so when  you get the info ready, you can send it to us directly.  Thanks. Regards, Janice EB3811 Assistant General Counsel, Enron North America Corp. 713-853-1794 (Fax:  713-646-3490)
