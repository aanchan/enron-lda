    	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 The Option Investor Newsletter - Trading Alert We are concerned about the Asian markets tonight and how they will react to Brazil. We feel you should consider closing open positions before the end of the day in case Asia self destructs tonight. The U.S. markets have recovered strongly but are still showing signs of further weakness. Time to be careful until a new market trend is established. Good Luck Jim
