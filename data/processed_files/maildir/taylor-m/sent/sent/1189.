Leslie Hansen 		  Mark; I don't know anything about a different version of the Legal and Privacy for  EBS.  Please advise if I should. Leslie 	Louise Kitchen 		 This  is the wrong one - this is the Phase 2 Legal & Privacy statement - I  need the one to roll out tonight on the EBS direct connection deals There have not been any revisions to this version.  If someone else needs to  receive/review, please let me or Leslie know. 	Leslie Hansen 		  Attached please find the revised Legal and Privacy statement for  EnronOnline.
