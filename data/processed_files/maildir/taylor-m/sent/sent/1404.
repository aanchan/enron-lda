Sorry about that - the request came while I was out of town and I missed it -  have now approved. 	Sara Shackleton 		  Are you having second thoughts about this? 		  We're waiting for Mark Taylor's approval. Do you have access to Lotus Notes?  Serge told us on Oct. 3 that he would have comments no later thatn the week of 10/16 and you would follow up with him. I'll try to call you when I have a free minute.  Sara                     "JASON PETERS"                     10/17/2000 Serge, I just wanted to get an update on when you thought we would have a response regarding the above-referenced ISDA.
