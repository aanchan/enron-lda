I'm not sure if you guys have seen this before or not.  Lousie seems to think  that you are preparing the U.S. version of this.     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe 	 	 I am not quite sure the context of this - if I were to issue a password to  someone (because I was going to give them readonly access) they would not  have to sign anything - the requiremetn is for a document to appear on the  screen though when they login - a read only ETA.  how doe these fit together?     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 Justin, I attach a revised Read Only Agreement. I understand that you will circulate this to the appropriate people. You will see that I have already copied it to Louise and Elena. Kind regards. Andrew  <<80s202!.DOC  - 80s202!.DOC
