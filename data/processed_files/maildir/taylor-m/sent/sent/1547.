This confirmation should have the regular Omnibus Annex A attached as well as  the additional Chilean Annex which Tana forwarded last week.  Please call me  if you have any questions. Mark 	Craig Breslau 		  Can you please help me to resolve this ASAP. Thank you, Craig I received from Derek Bailey the Confirmation Form  and the Chilean Annex,  but I feel there is still missing the Annex A, as it is  refferred in the  Confirmation Form as part of the terms and conditions of the  transaction.  Please confirm. ? Regards, Pablo Jaramillo ? ?
