What was this one about? David Forster OK - I hate the solution, but don't see any alternatives to the Master <31  vs.  31 day problem. Elena/Mark: Please coordinate as necessary to reintroduce the <31, 31 day  split for U.S. Gas. This means that U.S. Gas Product Types will now be  differentiated based on location (Inside/Outside Texas) and tenor (<31/31  days). Please amend the MPS and the database as required. Obviously, we would  like for these changes to be accomplished soon, so we can put all this stuff  to bed. Thanks, Dave
