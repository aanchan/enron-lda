Edmund: Rod Nelson has just informed me that Credit will not be approving Duke Energy  Trading & Marketing as a reference entity.  I don't think it makes sense to  review the various Duke confidentiality agreements at this point.  Please let  me know if the situation changes. Mark Edmund Cooper There are a variety of CAs with U.S. Duke Energy entities.    Mary J. Heinitz has provided me with a list of these which I'll forward to  Mark for his consideration under the cover of a separate email. Thanks, Edmund. John Metzler Edmund,  Please review the CA implications, as stated below. Thanks John Tomas Valnek 03/03/2000 13:29 Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple.  Duke Energy Trading & Marketing  is a marketing sub and does not prepare separate financials.  The S&P rating  is based on an implied guaranty from Duke Energy.  Legal would also need to  review this counterparty from the standpoint of confidentiality agreement  violations.  Also, as a trading counterparty, Sempra Energy Trading is not authorized for  credit derivative trading, because the existing guaranty does not explicitly  cover this type of transaction.  If Sempra wishes to transact out of this  entity, we can look into amending the guaranty to cover this product.  This  will require legal efforts and approval. Rod Tomas Valnek Both of  these entities have an E-rating of 3. Any issues?
