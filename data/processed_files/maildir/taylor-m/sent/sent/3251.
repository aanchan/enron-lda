Approved.  Do we have extra monitors/keyboards already on the floor? 		  Mark: Samantha Boyd is in need of a new computer monitor/ keyboard.  The monitor  screen is visibly unclear which makes it extremely difficult to read.  In  addition, the keys on the key board are sticky.  With your authorization, can  these items be replaced with new equipment?  Please advise. Thanks, Holly Keiser Enron Americas Legal Department - EB 3887 713-345-7893 (ph) 713-646-3490 (fx)
