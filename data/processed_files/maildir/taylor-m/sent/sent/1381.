Any hope of  a time for Lisa?  Please get in touch with her and let her know  the situation. 		  yours? Lisa Yoho Mark -- Rick Shapiro has asked that I coordinate with you on CFTC issues since I'll  be handling government affairs matters for Enron Global Markets and Enron  Networks.     Would it be possible to meet sometime this week (or early next week) to talk  about this?   I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday of this week, and  all of next week.   Let me know what works for you. Looking forward to meeting you. Lisa
