Sorry for the delay - our general policy is (and the first response to this  type of question should be) that , due to system requirements, it is not  possible to provide for different online contracts for different  counterparties.  Having said that, in the few cases where a counterparty has  raised what we consider to be valid and material concerns, we have agreed to  a side letter agreement with that particular counterparty to vary the terms  of the ETA.  So if the counterparty resist the first response and threatens  to not use the system for legal reasons, you should refer them to the legal  department.  They can contact either Carol St. Clair (x33989) or me (x37459). Hello Mark, I am trying to follow up on Remedy Tk ( 54001 ). I opened this Tk for this  customer having questions about the ETA. Please let me know, how you would  like to respond to customer's inquiry about modifications to the ETA.. Thanks.
