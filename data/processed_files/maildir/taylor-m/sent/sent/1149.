Either works for me. 	Becky Tlucek 		  	 We would like to reschedule our South American Legal Team meeting to  tomorrow, either at 1:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Houston time.  Which time would be  better for you? A quick reply would be most appreciated.  Since it is already so late in the  day, this will probably be finalized early tomorrow morning. -Becky
