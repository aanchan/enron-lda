The vacation time looks good to me.  My trip is nowhere near final yet so  let's hold off on rescheduling the credit group lunch. Don't come back until you're well! Carol St Clair Mark: The credit group lunch is scheduled for the 18th of February.  Do I need to  reschedule?  Also, were you okay with my vacation request of March 22-24th?   I hope to be back in the office tomorrow although I have signed up for a CLE  seminar at the Hyatt. Carol
