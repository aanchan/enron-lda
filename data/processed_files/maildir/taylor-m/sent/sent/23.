Congratulations and well done to you and all the others who have worked on  getting this agreement in place!  I know this was a long and difficult battle. Mark Shari Stack and I are proud to announce that we have finally received the  executed ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) dated as of  September 2, 1997 between ECT and Coral Energy, L.P.   Copies will be  distributed.
