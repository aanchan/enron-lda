Would you guys please take a look at this and let me know what sorts of  restrictions you would suggest we try and put on these guys and what sorts of  legal disclaimers/notices should be on the site? Thanks, Mark Michael Etringer Mark, As discussed, here is the URL for the proposed web site:    http://ecthou-lndev1.nt.ect.enron.com/westpowernet.nsf/ It is still on an internal server which I hope you will have access to.  Let  me know if it doesn't work.   The User ID is: "user1"  and the Password is:  "test"  . I also ran through several of the web sites from which we gather our  information and did not run across the occurance of any copyright statements. In terms of timing, we hope to release the site by the end of January to a  limited customer listing. Regards, Mike Etringer 503-464-3836
