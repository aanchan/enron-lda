	Jordan Mintz 		  We have arranged for representatives from tax, accounting, commercial, and  legal to make presentations relating to the purpose, structure, mechanics,  etc. associated with the Whitewing/Condor deconsolidated affiliate.  I think  that the more all of us are "conversant" with that structure, it should  simplify the legal efforts in closing deals---especially in Q4.  To that end,  please invite those colleagues of yours that could benefit from this  presentation and please let my assistant, Darlene Forsyth at x37254 , know  who will be attending so we can reserve the right size conference room and  order lunch. Thanks. Jordan
