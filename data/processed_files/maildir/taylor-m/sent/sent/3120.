		  Mark -- Can you follow up with Mark Taylor to make sure he has everything he needs  from us to help with the NDAs?  I am putting together a list of the  appropriate contact people at each company.  We will start having meetings  with these folks as soon as we have good NDAs.  The most immediate needs are  Oracle, SAP, IBM, and Sun.  Thanks. -- Rex 	Rex Shelby 		  Hello Mark -- Here is the initial list of companies for which we will likely need new  NDAs.
