	Daniel Diamond 		  Alan Engberg Dan, here's our first ever market commentary.  I gather the information will  be very stale by the time eol v2 is up and running and that this will serve  primarily as a place holder in our web page. From our perspective, we'd much prefer to have indenpendent "neutral" sources  (such as Platts, ICIS, CMAI ....) do the analysis, or at least do a feed.   The reason is (a) we'll never be construed as neutral and (b) we're so thin  that the traders themselves are the only ones who can put this together. Thanks, Alan
