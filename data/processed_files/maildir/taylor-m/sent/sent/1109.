	Daniel Diamond 		  Please REPLACE the Enron Broadband Services presentation with this one.   Thanks, Dan Dan, I didn't speak to slides 6, 9, or 14 of the original presentation sent to  you.  I think they are bad slides so you can either take them out or leave  them in with no audio.  If in the final review it is determined that these  slides should stay in, I am happy to come back in and do the audio for them.   The revised presentation is below, the original presentation is further down  in the e-mail Fred Cohagan Manager, Bandwidth Origination Enron Broadband Services Office:  713-853-1805 Mobile/Pager: 713-826-4485 About Enron: Most Innovative Company, 5th Consecutive Year, Fortune Magazine, February 21,  2000 Quality of Management, Voted 1st in US , Fortune Magazine, February 21, 2000 100 Best Companies to Work for in America, Fortune Magazine, February 21, 2000 	Erik Simpson 		  Erik Simpson Global Bandwidth Risk Management Enron Broadband Services Phone: +1 713-853-0600 Mobile: +1 832-689-4939 Facsimile: +1 713-646-8795
