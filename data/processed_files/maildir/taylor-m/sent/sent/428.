Per my conversation with Trisha Hughes the following is the proper coding for  the Enron OnLine Project (EOL). Company: 460 RC:  1491 W.O.:  E14911 Please use the rest of the proper coding all all other categories such as  detail class, etc. If you have any questions, please contact Trisha Hughes or myself. Thanks, Mary Jodi Dziadek Anthony B Dayao     	 	 	 The original W.O. # assigned E14911 on Co. 460 is the correct work order to  use.   Please let me know if you have any questions. Veronda Willis 853-7994 David G Mally Please use your normal coding for account major, account sub, detail class. Please add OEXP in the cost catalog description:  OEXP covers all expenses  except for payroll including meals, travel, and hotel (for your expense  reports). This work order is being set up in the ATES payroll system.  It will be  available for this pay period. I hope this change has not inconvenienced anyone. Regards, Dave     	 	 	 The following work order has been set-up to track expenses related to the  on-line project.  Travel expenses, other expenses, timesheets need to be  coded to the appropriate cost category within this work order.   Company # 460           W.O. # E14911 Regards, Dave
