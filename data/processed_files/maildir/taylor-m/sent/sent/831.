FYI Justin Boyd thanks mark - the contracts are physical, and as a result all C/Ps that trade  UK physical gas can have access. j     	 	 	 Justin - are the EnBank contracts physical or financial?  It seems to me we  should use the same customer profiles - that is if the contracts are  physical, then any counterparty which can trade physical UK gas should have  access.  If the contracts are financial, then any counterparty that can trade  UK derivatives should have access. Mark David Forster Justin, I am assuming that there is no reason from a legal perspective to restrict  access to EnronOnline EnBank Auctions - so we will proceed with setting up  the user profiles this way (I've already checked with credit). Please let me know if this is assumption is incorrect and we need to restrict  access. Thanks, Dave
