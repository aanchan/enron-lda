		  Mark - FYI regarding the BankLogic matter.  I plan on attending to at least see  where this is headed.  After looking at the term sheet attached to the  earlier memo, I would be happy to be responsible for this project, but this  may be a deal Travis is better suited for.  If you think it is best for you to attend this afternoon, please let me know.
