Phillip C Randle Mark I talked to Bob Crane of the Pulp and Paper group and was informed that  all of the necessary paper work pertaining to contractual issues were in place pertaining to  getting the OEM software setup. Wanted to know had you heard anything about this. Let me know if you have  heard anything. Phillip x39665
