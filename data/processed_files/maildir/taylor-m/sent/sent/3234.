Yes, a standard presentation that shows generally what traders see when they  use the system would be good.  We should definitely avoid being too technical. 		  Mark -- Chris and I were thinking that the standard presentation -- if it  isn't too technical -- would be appropriate.    What are your thoughts?  Lisa 	David Forster 		 Yes. What kind of demo is he looking for? Is it just a general overview (i.e. the standard EnronOnline presentation)? Dave David -- Would you be available on March 6th (around 3 - 3:30) to provide a  demo of EOL for the Chairman of the CFTC?  He'll be meeting with Jeff  Skilling before you, so  you'll be in good company!! Let me know if you can help us out.   Thanks, Lisa
