Janet H Moore There will be meetings in Houston at Enron to discuss the new draft of the  Offering Memo and the To Do Checklist as follows: 1.  Wednesday, August 25th, 2pm-7pm, in EB2868; and The Wednesday afternoon meeting is the MOST CRITICAL because Larry, John  Osborne of Skadden, and a few others are only available to meet on Wednesday.  Please make every effort to attend.  In addition, please review prior to the  meeting not only the revised OM, but also the checklist, a revised version of  which will be distributed later today to include Bob Baird's and my addition  thoughts. For those flying in from NYC, when you reach the Enron Building, please have  Enron Security call Larry's assistant, Kim Zachery, at 853-1971, who will  meet you on the 28th floor.  In her absence, please have Security contact my  assistant, Chaundra Woods, at 345-7621.
