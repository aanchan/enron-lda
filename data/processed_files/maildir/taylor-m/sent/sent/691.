As per Gary's request, here is the revised letter.  If you will send the  executed copies to me, I will arrange to have them signed on behalf of Enron. Mark,       The Confidentiality Agreement must be addressed to Enron and printed on Cemex letterhead, so please send the modified document to Cindy in an  electronic format (ie Word via email).  Cindy will then print out two originals on our letterhead and send you both originals for signature by Enron.   Thanks, GPB GARY BURNS Mark,        Our attorney said that modifying the attached Agreement so that the protected party is " CEMEX USA Management, Inc., as well as its affiliates (CEMEX), " is acceptable.  Please make the required changes and send the document to my secretary, Cindy Evangelista.   I am on vacation until  1/4/2000, but will try to progress the signing of the Agreement while I'm gone.   Regards, GPB cc: Here is the Confidentiality Agreement we signed last year. (See attached file: CA - Cemex2.doc)  - CA - Cemex2.doc
