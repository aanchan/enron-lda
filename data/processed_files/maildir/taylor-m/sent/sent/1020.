    	 	 	 Mark,  This resume is the daughter of a Director in Human Resources.  She has a law  degree and has worked as a legal assistant/paralegal throughout her career.  I do not think her  background is as strong as some of the other candidates that you have seen.  But, I decided to send it anyway because it  is an employee referral.  Take  a look at it and let me know what you think. Nedre 31659  - SILCOX~1.DOC
