This looks fine to me.  Is this the way our confirmations read for telephone  trades?  If not, do we need to make this change there also? Mark Please aprove the folowing and I will make the required changes. Dale David Forster Dale, I have discussed the wording with Rudy and agree that we could change the  wording in the Index long description for Gasoline, #2 and WTI as follows: Old: The Index for a month shall be the arithmetic average of the daily   settlement  prices for the prompt month NYMEX West Texas Intermediate Light, Sweet, Crude  Oil  futures contract for each NYMEX trading day of such month. New: The Index for a Determination Period shall be the arithmetic average of the  daily   settlement prices for the promptmonth NYMEX West Texas Intermediate Light,  Sweet,  Crude Oil futures contract for each NYMEX trading day of such Determination  Period. Please run these changes past legal before proceeding. When your changes are  complete, please run the final version past Rudy as well. Please note that  all  Products which reference these Indexes will need the secret squirrel  treatment for  updating. Niamh/Duncan: Please advise if you are happy for the above change to be  applied  to your products as well. Thanks, Dave
