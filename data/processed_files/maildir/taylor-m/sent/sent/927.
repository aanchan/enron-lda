Did we ever talk about this?  The traders (Bob Crane in particular) are  giving Dale a hard time - they want to start trading this way immediately. When we met least Wednesday on this subject you mentioned that you wanted to  consult Tax and Legal abroad to determine our course of action; you then left  a voice mail message with your tax contact. Any updates? Dale 3-9746
