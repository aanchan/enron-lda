Angeline Poon 		  Hi Tana - We are trying to put in place an ISDA Master Agreement between Enron  Australia Finance Pty Ltd and Enron Capital & Trade Resources International  Corp (Singapore Branch).    Enron Australia has already signed on the  document. Can we send it to you to help us get the necessary signatures for  ECTRIC (Singapore Branch)? I have prepared the following documents but not sure if they are most up to  date: 1. Certificate of Assistant Secretary 2. Certificate of Secretary 3. Unanimous Consent of Directors (this is incomplete cos I am not sure of  the part starting from RESOLVED ..) Is there any other documents that I have missed out?  Would appreciate your  help and guidance whether I have done the above correctly.  If there is  anything incorrect, please guide me accordingly. Many thanks Angie
