Welcome Back!   Looks like BP has finally signed.  As I understand it, this should open the  way to get them signed up in the U.S. 	Justin Boyd 		  Larry Please see below Justin Justin Boyd 08/09/2000 16:19 thanks! Justin- Here's the signed letter from BP..... unfortunately she has signed the North  American Password Application!  So I've left a message for her to phone me  again.  She'll have to sign the UK version before we'll set her up. Lara London Fax System 08/09/2000 14:18 You have received a new fax from 02075797778 The image contains 4 page(s).
