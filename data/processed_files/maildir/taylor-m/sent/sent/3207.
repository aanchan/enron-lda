Any thoughts? 	Peter Keohane 		  Mark, I am getting complaints by traders and orginators that  they are  missing significant commercial opportunities, especially in our newly  deregulated power market, as they are unable to get ISDAs turned around.   Frankly, I do not know what is the cause for the delay, or whether it is  Legal, Credit or Enron Corp. Legal, or the specific cases.  I do know that  Enmax Energy Corp. and Encore Energy Solutions are two specific cases on the  power side.  Can you look into this and let me know if we (Legal) can speed  up the process. TX, Peter.
