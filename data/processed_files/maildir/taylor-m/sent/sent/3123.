		  Hi Mark -- Attached is Oracle's standard NDA.  We can work with it if you like it or use  our own. The Oracle folks are dropping by Enron here in Houston on Friday of this week  (the 5th).  If we are able to put an NDA in place by then, we will go into  more detail with Oracle at the meeting.  If we do not have a new NDA in  place, we will keep the meeting high level.  Thanks for your help.  Best  regards. -- Rex 		   - M&ACDAwithterm1.doc  - michael.boese.vcf
