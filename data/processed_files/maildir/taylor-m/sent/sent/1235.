This may be pertinent. 	Justin Boyd 		  Jon, I had a glance over the written paper from Sullivan & Cromwell as to FX  Transactions, and it seems to me that there would be fewer US regulatory  issues (should there be any), if we were to use MG Brokers Inc, the FCM  entity.  Are there any other reasons why we would not want to use this entity? [Mark/Alan/Marcus - I have separately sent you by email the Sullivan &  Cromwell paper] Thanks. Justin 09/08/2000 16:37 Jon,  My suggestion would be for the FX business be run out of a NON FCM firm in  the states (NY) since it is a non-regulated product.
