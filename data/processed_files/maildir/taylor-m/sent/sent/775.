Louise Kitchen We need to act on this today - what is your advice on how we proceed based on  the fact that they clearly appear to be in breach. 	 Louise, the contract is clear on this.  Here is what is states in ATTACHMENT  a.  Publicity "Contractor shall never reference Company in any advertising or publicity  without its written consent.  Specifically, no reference must be made to  Company or any of its affiliates in any form of communication, wither verbal  or written or through any other media, including but not limited to printed  advertising or marketing materials, oral or print presentations, digital or  online media, or any other reference whatsoever to Company without the  express prior written consent of Company.". Let me know if you need anything additional  gene Could you both please verify that the following use of our name is a breach  of contract on Agency's side.  They also want to do a press release which we  have not agreed to and I will be saying no to this on Monday.  I would like  to follow this with some legal reponse to this breach in contract immediately  - ie tomorrow. Let me know what you think. Louise Philippe A Bibi Louise, Lets get the lawyers involved Agency CANNOT mention our name without our  written approval. Lets get this done on Monday. Thanks P.
