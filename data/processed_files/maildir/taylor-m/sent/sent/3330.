		  Good Afternoon, The spring Monmouth College Board of Trustees meeting is just around the corner and we are in the process of scheduling meals and reserving hotel rooms.  The meeting packets are on their way to you by mail today, but thought I would try electronic mail instead of the standard return card for inquiring about your room reservations and dinner selections. If you are planning to attend the meeting please let me know by return email or by phone (309) 457-2127, and answer the following: Hotel rooms are on hold for April 19 and 20.  Do you need a room reserved at the Hawthorn Inn for the 19th and/or the 20th of April,  and for how many people?  (If you have responded to the Development Office for the 19th, I have received that information.) Menu selections for Friday's dinner are: 1. Herb Crusted Dijon Lamb 2. Roasted Duck Breast 3. Mushroom Ravioli with Roasted Pepper Coulis (no cheese or cream in/on this selection) Please select Option 1,2 or 3. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thanks, Deborah Deborah Davis Secretary to the Trustees Monmouth College PS:  Here are the schedules of Friday and Saturday events for your review.
