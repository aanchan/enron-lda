The EnronOnline guy responsible for the video is trying to get the contractor  we used to get these guys to stop using our name.  Louise may want us to  contact them if he is not successful. 	Louise Kitchen 		 Unfortunately, they had nothing to do with EnronOnline.   It was a promo  video we can't use. They were a company that was subcontracted out to do a promotional video for  EnronOnline.  The people we contracted with is the one Enron uses for all  videos - I believe are suing Hydrogen as the video is unusable. Kal and legal are chasing.

A company called Hydrogen Interactive is highlighted, and one  of the highlighted claim to fames of Hydrogen is some work that they did for  Enron Online.  This should increase Enron exposure in the techworld as this  macromedia site is well followed.  Links below. http://www.macromedia.com/showcase/ http://www.h-i.net/
