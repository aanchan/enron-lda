We have not admitted hedge funds to trade in the US because of the heightened  regulatory scrutiny of trading with hedge funds generally since the Long-Term  Capital Management debacle of last year.  These same issues may not apply in  the UK. 	Marie Westin 		  Hi guys, I hope you can help me.  Are there any issues with us trading with Hedge  funds on EnronOnline?  Galtere have applied and seem to be one. I look forward to hearing from you.

However, in the case of the Galtere, please check with the US PCG whether  trading with Hedge funds gives rise to any particular legal issues.
