I'm pretty sure SITA is a French company.  Have we decided that French  counterparties are ok? Tanya Rohauer Please prepare a deemed ISDA for the SITA deal.  Please forward to Jarrod  Cyprow on the confirm desk. Please note the only credit specification is a  cross default to third party debt.  Let me know if you have questions. Thanks, Tanya 	Heather Alon
