Melba - Please draft a ticker item and let's make these changes as quickly as we can. Dale Scott Neal US Gas Swap works fine.  Thanks for being creative and flexible. Let's go  with this ASAP. I brought this issue up to David Forster AGAIN, and again he suggests that if  we are going to change the Product Description that we call it US Gas Swap -  so a Product on the website would read, for example: US Gas Swap   IF CNG SP               Jun00           USD/MM We really don't want to change the name to Fixed/Float because the US Gas  Daily products are ALSO Fixed  Float trades, and we are afraid we would be misleading.  Please talk about this and if this suggestion is acceptable we will make the  changes. Also please remember that this change requires manual intervention, so each month when you roll the product  over you will need to let us know to  make the change when you call to have the product activated. We also won't be  able to use Tokenized Reference  Periods on these Products. Dale
