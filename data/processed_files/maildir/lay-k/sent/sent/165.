Eye lobbb uuu Stephenson, Richard G.; Jacobs, Michael A.; Schwartz, William I. I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this is a hoax: http://urbanlegends.about.com/culture/urbanlegends/library/blemtax2.htm Here's an excerpt from the U.S. Postal Service's published response: A completely false rumor concerning the U.S. Postal Service is being circulated over the Internet via e-mail. The e-mail message claims that a "Congressman Schnell" has introduced "Bill 602P" to allow the federal government to impose a 5-cent surcharge on each e-mail message delivered over the Internet. The money would be collected by Internet Service Providers and then turned over to the Postal Service. No such proposed legislation exists. In fact, no "Congressman Schnell" exists.
