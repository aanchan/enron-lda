Rob, Ken said this is fine. Rob Bradley Gary Hamel and I went back and forth once more after your last input, and  here is where we came out. At this point your blessing or revision on this blurb will be the final. - ROB Perfect, Rob. Thank you. Grace  I dropped "own" before "business life" to reduce wordiness and substituted  Gary's two suggestions.  Is this now okay? "Gary Hamel's 'revolutionary entrepreneurship' model represents a substantial advance in our understanding of what companies must do to become outstanding innovators.  It should influence not only top management but also every employee who, indeed, is the CEO of their business life."  If so, I'll send it up to Ken.  Thanks,  ROB  cc:  Hello Rob,  Gary agrees that "radical" might not be the best choice.  He said that  "outstanding" innovators would be fine.  On another note, he still feels that "significant, qualitative" advance...  is a bit long.  Wonders if "substantial" would suffice?  But he leaves this  one entirely to you.  Hope to hear from you on Monday.  All the best,  Grace   We are getting very close.     My only concern with #2 is the word radical.  That's good for you but may   not be for Ken.     What would you think of replacing "radical innovators" with "outstanding   innovators" or "super innovators"?     One concern I have about radical is that you can be radical and not   successful (unprofitable).  You could be bold and very wrong (picking the   wrong revolution) or just ahead of your time (which is still resource   misallocation to economists).     If you want to think of acceptable replacements for "radical," I'll then   let Ken decide which word his wants (including the choice of radical) and   put the quotation to bed.     - ROB       cc:       Hello Rob,     Here are Gary's suggestions.     Your thoughts?     Grace     Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit    Ken Lay on Leading the Revolution     Dear Rob . . . thanks again for taking the trouble to help me with a   blurb from Mr. Lay.     Here are two slightly reworked quotes.  I must say, I like the second   one more than the first. I hope it is acceptable to you.     "Gary Hamel's 'revolutionary entrepreneurship' model represents a   significant, qualitative advance in our understanding of the principles   and practice of innovation.  It should influence not only top management   but also every employee who, indeed, is the CEO of their own business   life."     "Gary Hamel's 'revolutionary entrepreneurship' model represents a   significant, qualitative improvement in our understanding of what   companies must do to become radical innovators.  It should influence not   only top management, but also every employee who, indeed, is the CEO of   their own business life."     Gary.
