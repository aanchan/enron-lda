Chris, Below Wei explains what the option class cd column should contain. Please fix  this error before saving the file out tonight.  If you have any questions let  me know. Thanks, Robin     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Robin, I have set it up for this spreadsheet and I already ran it in stage  database.  The only error message I got was 'OPT_CLASS_CD INVALID'.   'EUR'.  'USD' in the spreadsheet is more like a currency_cd. Wei Robin Rodrigue
