Kathy, I am attaching a revised P&L by Trader.  I moved the Term_GD p&l from Lambie  to McKay.  We are, however, still off $35,000 on McKay.  It looks like the  file got updated after we pulled in the final Feb. p&l.  Since we've already  reported Feb, I can't restate something that would change the total p&l.  An  adjustment will just need to be made in March to correct the Feb. variance.   Robin Kathy Reeves Robin, I have a couple of differences for February. Could you please take a look at  them. Kathy Robin Rodrigue Here's the final Feb. file.   Let me know if you need anything else.   Robin Kathy Reeves Robin, Would you be able to send me the file for Feb 28th. Kathy Robin Rodrigue Here you go.  This is the P&L we reported as of 3/2/01. Let me know if you have any questions. Robin Kathy Reeves Robin, Could you please send me Canada's p&L that you are reporting.  The same file  that you sent last month is fine.  This is what our income should be. Kathy
