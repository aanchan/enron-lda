I spoke with Monica about this issue yesterday.   Robin Chris Abel The gas group stopped publishing it to the website, but I am not sure if they  use the info for other purposes.  Maybe Robin or David can respond to that  issue. Chris Chris, most of the remaining people on the distribution list are EES  management.  Does Corp no longer require the Basis position report to be  prepared daily?  If so, we will no longer send it. Thanks, MYH You can take Michael Benien and myself off of the list, as we no longer use  this report.   Additionally, you should remove Rahmaan Mwongozi and Gabriel  Monroy as they no longer work in the gas group.  You might want to check with  the others to see if the report needs to continue going to them also. Thanks, Chris Please find the attached EES Basis Position Report. Thanks,  Monica
