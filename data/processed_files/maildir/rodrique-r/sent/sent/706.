Read what you wrote sometime when your not so tired, and let me know if you  understood it....b/c I sure didn't!!  I have no idea what you're trying to  say.  So just imagine me nodding my head and smiling politely. RR Becky Pitre Either they have spare time or they are doing it in their sleep.  I really  don't want to think of anyone I know here working on having babies.  I say  that and yet I know Tracy is trying to get pg.  She says she is tired of  always having her legs in the air.  I know she doesn't have any spare time.   Maybe she utilizes her time by doing two things at once.  Like eating dinner  and you know...... Or like, heck I don't know.  My brain is mush.  See ya.  B Robin Rodrigue You mean there are Enron employees with spare time??   Becky Pitre Are you here yet? There are thousands of kids here today.  They are in every nook and cranny.   Dang, I'll be glad to get out of here today.  Are there thousands of kids on  your floor too?  We now know what Enron employees do in their spare time!!  B
