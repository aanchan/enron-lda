I thought Bilal was still looking at the Enovate books.  Robin Bilal Bajwa Robin, Don't make the changes to the portfolios yet. We have been looking at these  books already- for we need to actually take Enovate out of Agg-gas IV as  opposed to adding it in Agg-Gas... Lets talk about it before we add these books! Thanks, Bilal     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 What is the status here? Thanks, Frank Ramesh, Here is the reconciliation of the portfolios.  The third sheet shows what  books need to be added to Agg-gas and what needs to be added to Agg-Gasiv. Thanks, Robin Ganapathy Ramesh
