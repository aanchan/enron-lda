    	Enron North America Corp. 	 	     	 	 	 Frank, Please find enclosed the PL/SQL scripts that are called from the two C  programs below. The ERMS packages handle all of ERMS positions, with specific  handling of Canadian and Intra month positions. The power package handles all  of ENPOWER databases(Australia, Europe and US) and EXPOWER(US only). The  spreadsheet handling is an entirely different process which specifically  handles text files extracted from spreadsheets. The 'C' programs control the calls to the PL/SQL packages. The ERMS package  also decides on the strip flag for intra month positions. Regards, Ramesh
