Her ema= il=20 Thanks for your immediate attention to this matter, Corinna Bolender Desk: 713-345-4388 Cell:   512-632-4285 NRO Bob and Corinna, Here are the versions of the MOU your lawyer will need to review.  As expected, some of the items just did not make the bar to warrant a change.  Specifically: an actual date for the released product will not go on the MOU. Customers who particpate in the JDP have a high degree of touch and disclosure with MS.  Although we are glad to discuss dates and they draw near with the customer we do not promise anything from the beginning (though this hardly matters now considering the date). The line in #4 that was cut and pasted to #17 has been placed back in #4.  This is due to the placement of the topic in #4.  The rest of #17, specifically stating that there is NO COST TO THE CUSTOMER has been left in on #17, and I'll probably incorporate this for future use.  It is a good addition. #10 on Microsoft's section has been removed.  It is clearly rednundant and not necessary.  We already say there is absolutely no cost to the customer. If this is agreeable (I have included the red lined version, so your lawyers can review), the final version with those changes have also been included.  Please print, sign and return. Thanks! JamMo! Cc: Susan Chang (LCA) James - per our phone call this afternoon, I've revised the MOU. Attached is the redlined version as well as the final doc.  Please let me know if you have any questions. Susan Susan, I would like to permanently modify our MOU to the following for our Joint Development Programs.  It is redlined, so you can review the exact changes.  This is actually from the customer, but I like what they changed and added, I just want to be certain that it's not going to come back and bite me later.  Roughly 4 or 5 sentenced. Thanks for you help! Cc: Bolender, Corinna; Ogg, Jim Hi, James.  I've attached a copy of the MOU which contains some minor changes suggested by one of our attorneys.  Let me know what you think. Thank you.  <<JDP MOU 02-02-2001(microsoft- enroncomment5-1-01).doc Bob Ward Manager, IT - Development ext. 54409  - JDP MOU 02-02-2001(microsoft- enroncomment5-1-01).doc << File: JDP MOU= =20 02-02-2001(microsoft- enroncomment5-1-01).doc =20  - SQL 2000 SP1 JDP MOU.doc << File: SQL 2000 SP1 JDP MOU.doc =20
