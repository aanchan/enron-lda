Per email from Leslie Hansen, one of our power attorneys, counterparty cannot  transact US physical power.  On the financial side, we just got an ISDA  Master Agreement in place with this Counterparty, so they should be ok for  all financial (except Credit Derivatives (bankruptcy swaps)).  We will only  consider those on a case by case basis.  Per Sara Shackleton, an attorney in  the Swap Group, there is nothing about this counterparty that would require  any special reps and counterparty should not in any way be considered a  "governmental".  No Argentina gas for any non-Argentina counterparties.  All  other US products appear to be OK.   	Leslie Hansen 		  Tana: This CP is not authorized to trade physical US power products.  I will leave  it to you to determine if it should be granted access to any other  commodities. Leslie 	Imelda Frayre 		  Just forwarding this to you per Justin Boyd's request.
