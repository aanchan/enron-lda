That job is with Bob Williams, the litigation attorney for our international  company.  Bob is a great guy, probably one of the funniest people I have ever  known.  It also might be a good job for you because he promoted his last  administrative assistant to paralegal. 		  Thanks for writing back.  I could probably do the Saturday evening thing.  I will let you know soon. If you get a chance, check out Job No. 105738.  Know anything about it?? cc:                      09/18/2000  The name of the plant I told you about last week is DURANTA.  Think you will want it??       That job I passed on your resume to in our group, I checked, and they  still   haven't started interviewing people yet, since Barbara is on vacation  dropping   her daughter off at college.
