Looking forward to seeing you. cc:                     05/18/2001 12:14 Good Morning!! Phyllis, Carol and Monnie are all planning to make breakfast at 10 at BG. Did you get in touch with Holly and Lucinda?  Call anyone else you want... See you then.  I will bring your bike. I think I am only working til mid-day today. cc:                     05/17/2001 05:53 Good!!  If you want to get Hollie, Lucinda, etc., to come, please feel free to do so.  Is there any special place you want to go??? I have been thinking about you as well.  I have your bicycle and will return it to you when you are ready for it.  I can bring it on Saturday.  Will it fit in your car?  If not, I can drop it by after breakfast.  Might need to come by anyway to see what else you have done to it. I will call Carol, too, if you don't care. cc:                     05/17/2001 05:33 Miss Tana, Is there a chance you might like to try to get together this weekend?  I thought I would check with you first and then see if Phyllis is available. I have a hair appointment at 8 a.m. on Saturday.  We could do breakfast at 10, or whatever... Let me know. Patti (
