		  This is the response I got from Green Mountain.   Tim Smith said you  had a form of confidentiality agreement you had sent to  him.  We have  taken the time to prepare and provide you a confidentiality  agreement which  contains substantive provisions that have already been  reviewed by your counsel  in our other dealings.  Many of the provisions are  very similar both  agreements.  Therefore, please have your counsel review  that document as  soon as possible.   John K.
