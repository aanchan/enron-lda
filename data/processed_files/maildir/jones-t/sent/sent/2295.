Justy, Re: the below, we shouldn't be signing passwords any more for ENA, so I  wanted to confirm with you that I should only be preparing this resolution  for EOL...? 	Justin Boyd 		  ..what a star you are!! justin These could take a few days (or more!).  They have to be circulated to the  directors of the Company for signature and timing will depend on their  availability for signature.  If Amita wants to start signing today, she can  go ahead and start signing now and I'll make her appointment effective as of  today. 	Cindy Buckley 		 Hi Tana Thanks for quick response. I'm happy for the unanimous consents of the directors and the  attorneys-in-fact.  Please could you let me know when these have been signed  and are effective. Thanks for your help. Regards
