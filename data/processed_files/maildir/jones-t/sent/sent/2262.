Attached is the final version of the Enron Corp. Guaranty.  Unfortunately,  the ISDA Schedule is in the hands of Deutsche Bank and I need them to turn  around the revised draft.  I'm still working on it. 		  Tana, Thanks for this.  It would be very helpful if you could send me the latest versions of the Guarantee and the Schedule just indicating which is the only outstanding point.  That way we can prepare the versions for EnronCredit.com Limited based on these and get things as close to finalised pending the outcome of this last credit point that you refer to. My fax number is 0207 330 9999. Many thanks for your assistance. Kind regards, Clare cc: Bank ISDA Master Agreements Many thanks for the update. Bank ISDA Master Agreements Many thanks.

Kind regards, Clare  Tanna,  Could you please give me an update on where things stand on the  finalisation of the Guarantees and Schedule with Deutsche.  I understood  that the guarantees were with Enron Corp. for final approval and  signature.  Is the documentation now agreed? As you are aware the  negotiation of the documentation with EnronCredit.com is dependent upon  the finalisation of the documentation outstanding with Houston.  Many thanks for your help.  Kind regards,  Clare  Tanna,  Thanks for your help on the Goldman Sachs and Deutsche negotiations.  If  you could keep me posted on the timing of the Deutsche agreements being  put in place that would be really helpful.  I also have another quick  request and that relates to the ISDA Master Agreement with FUNB.  I have  spoken to Delene Travella at FUNB.  They are negotiating an ECTRIC  Schedule with you in Houston which they want to finalise before commencing  EnronCredit.com's negotiation.  Can you give me an update on where this  negotiation stands and how long before it is likely to be finalised?
