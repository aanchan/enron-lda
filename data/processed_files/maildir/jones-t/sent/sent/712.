FYI, about the Canadian master netting agreements.     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources  	Canada Corp.  	 	 It was Canadian Natural Resources, and we are still working on it along with  a host of other issues but we hope to have something signed by mid-week next  week.  CNR is the priority, but we have also been talking to Petro-Canada and  others but have not yet crossed the issue of executing an agreement. Regards, Peter     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 This came up at our Group meeting today, did you ever sign that Master  Netting Agreement for Petro-Canada at year end?
