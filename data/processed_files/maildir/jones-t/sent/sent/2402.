Sara Shackleton, an attorney in our group, is drafting some language that we  will be proposing to Deutsche Bank in response to their request that we add  the Enron companies they do financial business with to the definition of  "Specified Entity".   We have some concern that by adding certain Enron  entities to Specified Entity, a default in a swap transaction could possibly  default certain structured loan transactions with a swap component, and we  are trying to carve those transactions out.   Sara is also working on the FUNB agreement.  I checked with her and the FUNB  agreement we had been working from was so old that we agreed to start from  the latest form of our agreement, so Sara sent Dee Travella at FUNB a revised  draft on 11/8/00.  Sara's direct phone no. is 713/853-5620.   		  Tana, Hope you are well.  I wondered whether you had had any progress on the final form of the Deutsche Schedule yet? or any progress on the FUNB documents? Thanks for your help in keeping us up to date on the status here. Best regards, Clare Bank ISDA Master Agreements Tana, Thanks for this.  It would be very helpful if you could send me the latest versions of the Guarantee and the Schedule just indicating which is the only outstanding point.  That way we can prepare the versions for EnronCredit.com Limited based on these and get things as close to finalised pending the outcome of this last credit point that you refer to. My fax number is 0207 330 9999. Many thanks for your assistance. Kind regards, Clare cc: Bank ISDA Master Agreements Many thanks for the update. Bank ISDA Master Agreements Many thanks. Apologies for the error, I obtained Tana's e-mail details from someone at Enron in London and they had misspelled it for me. Thanks again for all your help. Clare cc: ISDA Master Agreements Mark, I am having some problems sending this to Tanna.  her e-mail keeps bouncing back.  Could you pass this on to her please? many thanks for your help. Kind regards, Clare  Tanna,  Could you please give me an update on where things stand on the  finalisation of the Guarantees and Schedule with Deutsche.  I understood  that the guarantees were with Enron Corp. for final approval and  signature.  Is the documentation now agreed? As you are aware the  negotiation of the documentation with EnronCredit.com is dependent upon  the finalisation of the documentation outstanding with Houston.  Many thanks for your help.  Kind regards,  Clare  Tanna,  Thanks for your help on the Goldman Sachs and Deutsche negotiations.  If  you could keep me posted on the timing of the Deutsche agreements being  put in place that would be really helpful.  I also have another quick  request and that relates to the ISDA Master Agreement with FUNB.  I have  spoken to Delene Travella at FUNB.  They are negotiating an ECTRIC  Schedule with you in Houston which they want to finalise before commencing  EnronCredit.com's negotiation.  Can you give me an update on where this  negotiation stands and how long before it is likely to be finalised?
