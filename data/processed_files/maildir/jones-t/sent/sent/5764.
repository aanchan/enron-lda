Yes, I fedexed TradeSpark out to them.  If you remember, I brought the file  copy around to you for the file. 		  Tana - Did we finalize the TradeSpark NDA yesterday?  Please let me know. Thanks. Mark Senior Counsel, ENA Phone:     713-345-8897 Facsimile: 713-646-3940 		  Thank you. My understanding is the pricipals want to meet Fri. If we can finalize today, that would ne great.     Mark, thank you. We would request that in Paragraph 3 the "Except as otherwise provided" languge be deleted and the language below be added in replacement. "The parties acknowledge and understand that this agreement does not limit or restrict the ability of either party to engage in its respective business, nor does it limit either party's use or application of any information or knowledge acquired independently of the other without breach of this agreement in the course of such business. Is this acceptable? I believe I understand your concerns - I would like to suggest that we add the following language after the first sentence of Paragraph 3 - and then execute the Agreement. Stephen - Since we keep missing each other, I wanted to drop you a note about the comments TradeSpark made to the Enron NDA. As to the comments: Paragraph 1 - The changes are acceptable. Paragraph 3 - The rationale for this deletion needs to be provided.  I cannot see why this change was made or is necessary. Paragraph 5 - This deletion is unacceptable to Enron. When you get a chance, please call me to further discuss Paragraph 3. Thanks. Mark Senior Counsel, ENA Phone:     713-345-8897 Facsimile: 713-646-3940
