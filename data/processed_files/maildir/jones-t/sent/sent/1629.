Because they are a governmental entity, in order to do financial our lawyers  would need to talk to them about their authorizing statutes, legislative  authority and possible legal opinions before they can trade financial.  So if  they want to trade financial, get me a name and phone number, probably of one  of their lawyers and we'll have to talk to them. 	Mary Griff Gray 		 Great -- thanks.  If they want to do financial, would that be possible? Just an heads up, they are open to trade physical power, which I expect is  what they want to trade, but not financial.   	Mary Griff Gray 		 Tana, Thanks for the info -- the customer will be excited to have permanent access. Griff Legal has signed off on the counterparty, so I expect it is being held up  with the online team for some reason. 	Mary Griff Gray 		 Tana/Claudia -- Could you bring me up-to-date on the progress of this app?   Thanks, Griff x35753     	 	 	                            	 Claudia --   I see that this app is still in Legal (since 7/14).  Could you  give me an ETA on it? Thanks, Griff 35753
