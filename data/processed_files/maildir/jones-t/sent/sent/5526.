fyi 	Tanya Rohauer 		 From CRM, I have asked Jay Williams, Brant Reves, Russell Diamond, Veronica  Espinoza, Rudwell Johnson, Darren Vanek, Aparna Rajaram, and Ken Curry to  attend.  I plan to attend as well.  Thanks! We are planning a Financial Training meeting next Tuesday at lunch.  This is  the first part of our training sessions on the Financial business. The  training will be facilitated by Brent Hendry.    I wanted to see if there are  any employees in your groups that would benefit from this training.  If so,  please let me know how many people will attend by tomorrow afternoon (Friday)  so that we can plan for proper seating as well as lunch.  Thanks!
