Marilyn, Do we have some documentation from the City that shows the City of Long Beach  with a "Inc." at the end of their name?  I have never seen a city with an  Inc. at the end of their name before, that is a corporate thing, not a  municipal thing... 	Samuel Schott 		 Any GCP adjustments will be highlighted in blue.
