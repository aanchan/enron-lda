Thanks, I know I've been a pest to you today! 	Shari Stack 		 they can do both buy & sales in the east & west.  S.  	Tana Jones 		  This counterparty came thru on 2/28/01 list.  I checked my database and we  had them open for power sales only on the pre-approval list.  When I checked  Profile Manager, it had them open for east & west power, transact on BOTH the  bid and offer.  Do you still want them to do power sales only?  Both east &  west?
