Narsimha, The NYMEX may require the aggregation of employees trading with the trades of  the Company.  Further, Enron Company Policy prohibits employees from trading  any commodities products that the company trades.  Therefore, in the future,  please do not trade any products the company trades.  If you have any  questions as to a specific product, please call me at x33399. 	Mark Taylor 		  		 I am in the process of opening a commodities account. -narsimha
