It's on its way! 		  Hi Tana, We did have it set up in the system without "Inc." but I got a request from  the settlements group to add "Inc." to the name.  I personally verified it  with the counterparty, and changed the record in GCP.  Lexis-Nexis shows that  it was incorporated in California in 1984 as Pacific Forest Resources, Inc.   Yes, please fax the articles to 713 646 5797, so I can get this clarified  once and for all.   Thanks, Cheryl x33103 GCP Response  Any GCP adjustments will be highlighted in blue.   << File: CP 05-14-01.xls    Rgds.    Samuel x3-9890  Enron Net Works _ Global Counterparty Team
