I've been trying to get Clickpaper to expand their product approval list to  match the products they offer...maybe your request will help! 	Karen Lambert 		 Do we have a current PA approval spreadsheet with approvals for all product  types available for trading? If not, are legal and credit okay with continued use of the abbreviated  spreadsheet attached? Also, for EOL PA approvals Credit supplies the new counterparty addresses on  the approval spreadsheet.   Can we please implement this as part of the approval process for Clickpaper?     	 	 	                            	 Attached are the Clickpaper Credit Approvals for 8/29/00. Regards, tm
