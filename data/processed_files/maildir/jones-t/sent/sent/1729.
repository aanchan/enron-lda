Do you know what to do here? 	Larry Joe Hunter 		  Susan/Tana, We have recently traded a deal on Enron Online in which the entity offering  Long Term Hedge.  Can we send out a confirmation based on ISDA terms since  this is an Enron subsidiary per Global Counterparty?  I'm assuming this is  just like doing a deal with Enron Global Exploration and Production, EES or  ECT International, but let me know if I'm incorrect. Thanks, Joe
