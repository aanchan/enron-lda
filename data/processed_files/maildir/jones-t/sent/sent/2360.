I'm talking to their lawyer right now.  He's checking with his power team to  find out what name their FERC license is in.  However, we still do not have a  Credit sign off on power yet, so I am also working with ("nagging") the power  Credit person to get me some headroom.  Let's just say ANP is "evolving" as  we speak! 	Mary Griff Gray 		 Tana -- Thanks for the prompt response.  Does this mean that eventually they'll be  approved for power, but not at this time?  Or, we'll hold up the transaction  ID until the power side is approved. Griff I heard back from the power lawyer and they do not appear to have a FERC  license.  He is going to have to talk to her and clear this up. 	Mary Griff Gray 		  Tana --- I talked to Jeff Mansfield this a.m. and he implied that they should  be receiving a blessing for transacting power.   I'm not sure where he got  that info, but it must not be true, huh? Thanks, Griff Bradley Diebner We approved these guys yesterday for gas.  Our power team is looking at them  for power, but a message came down from legal that they will probably be shut  down for power.  They are open for gas.      	 	 	                            	 Hey guys --- This company wants to be approved for both gas and power  transactions. Thanks, Griff     	 	 	                            	 Brad, Here's another one.  They come in groups you know.  Hopefully, this will be  the last credit question for a bit. How is the credit part coming on this company's app?  The latest Access data  base entry appears to be October 23rd. Thanks, Griff
