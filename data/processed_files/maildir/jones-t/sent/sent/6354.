Let's just keep it at 10 so we don't have to re-coordinate things. 		  I'm back.  I just changed my hair appt. to next week.  Would you rather meet at 9 or 9:30 in the a.m.?  Let me know soon so I can change everyone around. Should we leave it?  Phyllis is o.k. with either time. cc:                     05/17/2001 05:53 Good!!  If you want to get Hollie, Lucinda, etc., to come, please feel free to do so.  Is there any special place you want to go??? I have been thinking about you as well.  I have your bicycle and will return it to you when you are ready for it.  I can bring it on Saturday.  Will it fit in your car?  If not, I can drop it by after breakfast.  Might need to come by anyway to see what else you have done to it. I will call Carol, too, if you don't care. cc:                     05/17/2001 05:33 Miss Tana, Is there a chance you might like to try to get together this weekend?  I thought I would check with you first and then see if Phyllis is available. I have a hair appointment at 8 a.m. on Saturday.  We could do breakfast at 10, or whatever... Let me know. Patti (
