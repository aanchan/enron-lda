I don't think I need new tires, unless I'm surprised.  You might want to buy  an extra tire in case you get a flat.  I think I loaned Harry my old spare  tire.  Anytime Saturday is fine... 		  I have a tire pump, but I could take it to Bikesport and have new ones put on it and have it checked out. What do you think?  Could I check it out on Saturday? cc:                     02/28/2001 12:44 Tana Lou, I am back to bugging you about your bicycle.  Let me know when I can schedule a test ride.

I am still considering the MS 150 and wanted to know if your offer is still good for borrowing your bicycle.  If you have changed your mind, it is no big deal.  Promise! Patti
