No, please send to me and I will handle. 		  Tana, I just noticed that the contract is not signed by Dynegy. I have to send back  both originals. Do you want me to FedEx it to them or do you want to do it? Judy Tana, I have picked up the Dynegy Direct contract from Sally Beck.  Jean Mrha has  signed it, and I will be faxing a copy and mailing one of the originals of  the agreement back to Dynegy tomorrow. Please let me know if you need  anything else on this agreement. Thanks, Judy Thorne
