Below is a RUSH list that we need to approve by the end of the day.  From the  US, the only response I expect will be from Leslie, with all declines for  power.  I NEED TO HEAR FROM AUSTRALIA TODAY ON THEIR COUNTERPARTIES. 	Frank L Davis 		  	 Attached below is a list of Australian and Japanese counterparties for the  Australian and Japanese weather launch.  As they are actually launching these  products this afternoon, your immediate attention would be GREATLY  appreciated.  Let me know of any potential conflicts ( other than the obvious  lack of time) and I will do what ever possible to help. Thanks for your extraordinary efforts!!!!!!
