fyi 	Alan Aronowitz 		  Dale, could you please forward to John and me a copy of the EOL U.S. weather  derivatives GTCs and long descriptions for swaps and options so that they can  be looked at for Japan? By way of background, the traders in Japan (Jonathan Whitehead, Morten-Erik  Pettersen) want to start offering EOL weather derivatives (swaps and options)  through Enron Japan Corp. in lieu of Enron Australia as the Enron  counterparty, beginning the end of August 2000. Regards, Alan 		  Alan- As we will need to change the Enron counterparty for Japanese weather to  Enron Japan Corp. (on EOL), please have the US GTC's forwarded to me, so that  I can begin the process of amending same to conform to Japanese  law/practice.   I believe this will be better than attempting to modify the  Australian GTC's. Thanks, John
