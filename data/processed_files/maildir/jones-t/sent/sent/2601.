Yep, we had a nice time.  I tried calling you about 4:00 yesterday, but there  was no answer, so I figured you didn't want to go. 		  Hey, I totally forgot about last night (Sunday).  I was having my car washed about the time I should have been thinking about getting ready.  Please forgive me for I know it would have been a nice "do" to attend.  Did Michelle and you have a nice time? Thanks for going with me on Friday night. Talk to you soon.

We can meet there and then go to dinner. Or, you could come by my place and get a look again and help me pick out the right furniture.  Whatever is convenient for you, please let me know.
