Any word on the Nymex Letter? I am attaching a list of the 10-Q items that are still outstanding.  We would  like to get this information as soon as possible as our deadline for final  comments on the 10-Q is "scheduled" for May 10.  If you have any questions or  foresee any problems in providing the information applicable to you or your  group, please call me at 3-7230 or Jennifer Stevenson at 3-7230. Thank you for your time. Casey
