	Leslie Hansen 		 I have been authorized to open TVA to trade US power.  Accordingly, Tennessee  Valley Authority is authorized to trade US power via EnronOnline pursuant to  the on-line GTCs only.  Accordingly, TVA needs to receive an override letter  in the form attached below. Please call me with any questions or comments. 	Tana Jones 		  Can we open them up? 		  Tana, Please let me know the status of Tennessee Valley Authority.  I understand  the power desk is working with them once again and would like TVA to have the  ability to trade on EnronOnline.   I would like have them open for all US East Power. Thanks for your assistance. T.
