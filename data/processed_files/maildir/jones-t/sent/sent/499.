From what we have been able to determine, it appears that the City of  Riverside is not authorized to invest in any types of financial derivatives.       	 	 	 Frank L Davis Mark, The City Of Riverside has mailed in a password application form to trade on  EnronOnline (EOL).  This customer is considered a "muni" and we need to know  if there are any legal restrictions (by product type) that would keep them  from trading on EOL.  We would like to respond back to this customer as soon  as we receive approval/rejection back from our legal, credit, and tax  departments. Please contact me with any questions. Thanks for your help! Frank
