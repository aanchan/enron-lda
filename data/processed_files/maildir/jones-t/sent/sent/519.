Attached is another list for approval.  Under the comments section, if it  says "declined" you do not need to review it because Credit has not approved  the counterparty to trade, if it says "division" it means that it is a  division, and Credit has already approved it to trade under the counterparty  name to the right, if it doesn't say anything, it means it has been approved  to trade and those are the counterparties you should be reviewing. Molly Harris Frank Please find our approvals from last week consolidated on the attached file.   This should be helpful in reviewing the activity.   Regards Molly
