Never mind...! 	Shari Stack 		 Pls see below - I did answer you specifically about WAPA. I am OK to open  them for trading in the West. I don't know what CRSP means - maybe Credit does... 	Tana Jones 		 With respect to Western Area Power Administration - CRSP.  Can't "ditto"  Credit on that one, Credit gives no direction as to what they want to trade.   The database reflects that Leslie approved them to trade power already in  July of last year, so my intention is to keep them open.  I don't know what  "CRSP" means at the end of their name, do you? 	Shari Stack 		 Western Area Power Administration: Approved for West Physical Power, Buys and  Sales Utah Municipal Power Agency: NOT APPROVED  (not a current CP/Not FERC  authorized) With regard to everyone else on the list:  Ditto Credit Thanks,  Shari 	Tana Jones 		  		  Please see attached.
