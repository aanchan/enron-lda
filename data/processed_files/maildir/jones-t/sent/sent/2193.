	Justin Boyd 		 Tana If they could, that would be great! Thanks. Justinian We do not have an ISDA master in place with this cpy, however,  Susan Bailey  and Sara Shackleton did send them a draft in August.  I would think unless  ECTRIC is going to be a direct cpy to a master, Craig Young should contact  Susan and Sara directly...?

Gave the steel dept a reference --- combo account with Enron North America  across several commodities Craig     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Thks Craig Paul Adair My contact (hedging guy) talked to their steel purchasing guys who said that  this is more of the type of thing that they are looking for (i.e. vs. scrap  index from Nucor).  I am scheduled to see them on Tues Oct 31, the earliest  date that we could meet.  Looks promising for now. Paul
