All of the counterparties on today's list are ESP's, so I will approve them  for all financial products.  If the aren't ESP's I would not approve them for  financial products including Australian financial products.  Further, if they  cannot meet the ESP test on their own, i.e., they are relying on a parent  guaranty or a letter of credit to make them an ESP, I would approve them for  all financial products, except Australian power (but they could trade weather  per our earlier emails). 		 Assuming they want trade Australian power do  they have USD6million in assets? 	Bradley Diebner 		  The EOL approvals for 09/19/00 are attached below. Regards, bd
