Yes, I never got the signed NDA faxed to me. 		 Tana - Wasn't this the one we were supposed to have signed in Houston and faxed on  Friday?  So that I am clear, you are indicating we did not get a signed  document from PetroVantage?  If this is the case, I will call their counsel  today and find out where it is. Thanks.
