		  John - The legal department informed me that the Enron NDA would be mutually  binding and if we worked from your Purchase Pooling NDA that it would take a  few days before they could review the document.  Is it possible to work from  the Enron NDA or do you or your attorneys have specific questions?   pf 		  At the request of Paul Finken, I am attaching our proposed form of  Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please  mail or fax an executed copy to me.  If you have any comments or questions,  please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399.  My fax number is (713)  636-3490.
