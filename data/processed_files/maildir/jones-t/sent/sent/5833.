I spoke to the woman at Sask and she's ok on everything. 	Matilda Machado 		  Global Contract 96013849 Hi Tana, Further to Karen Lambert's email below, could you please let me know what the  status is with SaskEnergy?  Are they understanding the fact that their EOL  transactions will fall under the Master Agreement's terms and conditions? Let me know if I need to contact them.  Thanks, Matilda Global Contract 96013849   Yes, she is working with Tana Jones in Legal regarding New York  jurisdictional issues (and others).  You might want to touch base with Tana  in a few days while I am out. Matilda Machado Global Contract 96013849   Hi Karen, Did you follow up with this counterparty yet?  If not, I'll look after it.  I  just don't want both of us calling her.  Thanks. Matilda Contract 96013849 FYI -- The counterparty question below includes reference to a Canadian  Physical Gas master contract for online trading.  I am not certain which  other agreement they are questioning (online GTC? online ETA? other master  contract?).  When I tried to contact the counterparty her voice mail states  that Debbie is out of the office until March 6th.  At this point, I am unsure  if this is a purely "Canada gas" question or if they have questions that  cross-commodities and locations.  No specific action is needed by your  group.  I just want to make sure you are aware of any Canadian contract  issues.   (There is an open EOL Help Desk ticket pending until this question  is resolved.)  Please let me know if you have any questions or new  information that might help resolve this issue. Thank you, Karen x3-0605 Yes, it can wait....thank you for your help! Hi Bryan, Yes, we can help answer this question.  I will be out of the office until  tomorrow.  If it can wait, I'll get an answer then.  If not, then please let  Kelly Lombardi know and she can help while I am out of the office. Thank you, Karen (713) 853-0605 Karen, is this something you can help me with (below)? SaskEnergy has a Master Gas Purchase/Sale Agreement dated July 19,1995 executed with Enron.  With respect to EnronOnline, it is not clear which agreement or terms would prevail in the case of a difference between the 2 agreements.  Could you please clairfy? I can be reached at the above email or by telephone at (306) 777-9376 or fax (306) 569-3522.
