Mark, It seems to me Erica's advice needs to apply not only to this NDA, but  probably all of the NDA's that are going to originate from the Houston based  EnronCredit.com business team.  Further, it should apply not only to NDA's,  but their whole business they are originating from Houston, yes?  Maybe you  need to talk to Erica... 	Michael Slade 		  Tana Here is Erica's approval, as such - I have since explained what it is about  and she is happy with it Thanks Mike     	 	 	 I'm sorry for the delay.  I looked at the agreement and I have no problem  with it although, as a lawyer, it is dificult to envision how the English  courts are going to apply Texas law.  I would like to know what this is about  as I have no idea.  Can you please give me a call on 34916?  Thanks.
