You can take them off.  I spoke to Sara and Marie didn't want them to attend  and that is fine with Sara. 	Suzanne Adams 		 Sara told me to put them on the list.  I've got a voice mail into her  regarding same. On another note, is there anything you need for tomorrow.  I sent the email  saying the meeting was from 12 to 1:30 in 46C1 and lunch w/be provided.  Let  me know if there's anything else you need. 	Tana Jones 		 The list looks OK except take off Clement Abrams and Ted Murphy. 	Suzanne Adams 		  Tana, please look at that list as soon as you can.  I'd like to get the email  out today or tomorrow since we need rsvps for the food and drink.  Thanks, Suz
