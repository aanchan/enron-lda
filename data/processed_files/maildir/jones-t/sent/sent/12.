see lotus notes problems Tanya Rohauer Please see my Lotus Notes entry about changing the MAC clause. That should be  the last of the issues. Let's try to get this thing signed.  On another issue, why in the Lotus Notes Database, can I only send an e-mail  to credit people? I don't have the option of choosing anyone in legal, and  this is mainly whoi would use it for! Let me know! Thanks, Tanya
