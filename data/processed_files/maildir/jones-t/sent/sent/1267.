I'm glad to hear that someone from Credit it showing up!  I heard we weren't  going to have a good turnout from you guys, so I expect those that do attend  will achieve "favored Credit person" status. 	John Suttle 		 I was saving my energy for Marie's party tonight.   You know how ice cream  takes it out of you. Always my pleasure. ...I don't want to risk having you unhappy two days in a  row...by the way, where we you for the ice cream social?! 	John Suttle 		 Thanks Tana.
