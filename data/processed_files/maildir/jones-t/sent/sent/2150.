Secretary's office, and they were unaware that Rex and  Dave  were appointed as MD's, so the corporate paralegal is getting the board  resolution passed adding them on, as well as adding Mark Palmer as a VP. 	Louise Kitchen 		 Rex Shelby or David Berberian to sign Mike Haney with EBS. 	Louise Kitchen 		  PWC - whose NDA is it? Please exapnd to all VPs. Thanks
