Keep me posted on what you find out from this corporate search company.  I'd  be interested to see what prices we can work out.  I am also going to contact  Kate Cole and see if she uses anyone special.  If Enron Corp. does and they  have negotiated any special rates, maybe we can piggyback off of it.  I'll  keep you posted. Meagan Brinkworth Tana - hope this helps. Regards Meagan     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 05/08/99 14:29 	 Megan Hope you are well. Try "Experion" which provides online and offline services. Search fees range from about o35 to o135, and the info you receive varies depending on the country concerned. Best thing is for you/Scott/? to speak direct to Mary Keane at Experion on 0800 3280059. Sanjev Global counterparty is trying to locate online corporate search companies that can check company names in Europe and Canada.  In the U.S. we can access this information via Westmate in Westlaw.  Are either of you aware of any online search company, or can you direct me to someone who may be aware of an online search company, for Canada and Europe?  If there are no online search companies available, is there a reasonably priced corporate search company that can verify this information for us? I appreciate your help. <<File Attachment: pic04708.pcx
