Anyone have these merger docs? 	Marilyn Colbert 		 Calpine Power Services Company merged into Calpine Energy Services, L.P. eff  11/1/00, with the survivor being Calpine Energy Services, L.P. Copies of the  documents were hand carried to legal by Anthony Campos on 11/9. I believe he  gave them to Lisa. I am not certain why you have not received them yet.  Please check with her and then let me know if there is anything more I can  do. Thanks! MC So, back to my original question, is this a name change? 		  Please contact Cheryl or Marilyn Colbert for any name change, mergers,  acquisition documents Is Calpine Energy Services, L.P. a name change from Calpine Power Services  Company?  If it is I need to see the name change, because I have a financial  master executed under Calpine Power Services.  Can you fax it to me at  713/636-3490.  Thanks!
