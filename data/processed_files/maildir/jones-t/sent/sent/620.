Why don't you fax that letter up to me so I can figure out what it is,  646-3490... Susan Flynn  Tana - pleas handle.   Thank you! Joe - FYI -  All issues regarding online trading should addressed to Tana  Jones - she is the online key contact.     	 	 	 Susan, We have notified Bank of Montreal of our intentions not to verbally confirm  any deals in which we have done through a broker or through Enron Online.   BOM has therefore sent us a letter which confirms this for their auditing  purposes which they would like for us to sign.  We want to make sure Legal is  OK with us signing something like this before we send it back to them.  Let  me know if you want to see the Letter. Thanks, joe
