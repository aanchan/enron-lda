You are abviously a man of clear and discerning vision!  	Jeffrey T Hodge 		 Thanks Tana.  You are the best. 	Tana Jones 		 Yes it does.  It includes any original guarantees we may be giving or  receiving.    	Jeffrey T Hodge 		 Tana: Does this include original Enron Corp. guarantees?  On the physical side, we  have the counterparty sign the Enron Corp. document and therefore have an  original.  Let me know. Thanks, Jeff 	Tana Jones 		  Per the email below, please note that if you haven't been sending your  original guarantees to Credit, it appears this should be done so in the  future.  Please forward this email on to other members of your group that  might be responsible for filing original guarantees. 	Lesli Campbell 		  Tana,  I have talked with everyone involved, Anthony Campos, Mark Thorne, etc., and  everyone is in agreement that original guarantees should now come to credit.   If you could please, just make sure that they come to my attention so that  they can be briefed and entered into our Credit Agg System.  If you have any  questions please give me a call. Thanks Lesli 3/5983     	 	 	                            	 This is what we discussed a few weeks ago Just a followup note: We are still unclear as to whether we should continue to send original  incoming and outgoing guarantees to Global Contracts (which is what we have  been doing for about 4 years, since the Corp. Secretary kicked us out of  using their vault on 48 for originals because we had too many documents).  I  think it would be  good practice if Legal and Credit sent the originals to  the same place, so we will be able to find them when we want them.  So my  question to y'all is, do you think we should send them to Global Contracts,  to you, or directly the the 48th floor vault (if they let us!).
