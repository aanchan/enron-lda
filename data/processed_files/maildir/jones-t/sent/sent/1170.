Larry Gagliardi has been talking to Valero Marketing and Supply Company about  doing some gas crack business, and it appears Valero  will not trade with us  under the current form of Master Swap Agreement we have in place with them.   They will only trade under their form of ISDA Master, a copy of which is  attached below.  I spoke to their lawyer, Kim Bowers, who is very nice, and  she asked us to make our comments to their form by email.   After talking to  Tanya while you were out, it appears that we need to revisit their credit  situation since the credit under our existing master swap is quite old.  We  will try to work on reviewing the legal terms while we wait to get the credit. 		  Tana, can you let me know if you can take care of this request from Valero?  Thank you  3-0543 Larry - Please forward your request to Tana Jones, a paralegal who will certainly get  this to the right place. Tana can be reached at 3-3399. Dale Dale, Pat  Markey referred me to you. Valero sent me this request, can you  process it or tell me who can? Thanks for your call this morning.  I was in the middle of legging some gas cracks and had to go. Before we begin trading with you, we need to execute an ISDA.  I am attaching a copy of our standard schedule.  We have this agreement in place with all of the major dealers; and so, in general, we will not accept substantial changes to the agreement, particularly with regard to credit terms. Again,  thanks for your call, and I look forward to dealing with you in the future. John (See attached file: Schedule 5500.doc)  - Schedule 5500.doc
