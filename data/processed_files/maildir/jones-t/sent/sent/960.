Russell, In the future please put me on all notices about counterparty trading.  I am  responsible for the Legal Department's approval of online counterparties  across all product areas and need to know any limitations that might affect a  counterparties' ability to trade. Thanks! Susan Flynn  FYI     	 	 	                            	 American Central Energy, LLC's guaranty's have been revoked by their  guarantor, American Central Gas Companies.  The guaranty's include a $1MM  guaranty supporting financial trading and a $2MM guaranty supporting physical  trading.   NO TRADES should be approved going forward. The counterpary has been placed on Credit Watch for No Trades. The appropriate traders have been notified although most of their  transactions are executed through EOL.  Thier profile on EOL will be amended  to NO TRADES until more information is made available. Russell
