I just spoke to Mike Garred and John Raineri w/The New Power Company.  Per  this conv. it appears that ENA has master agreements in place to trade  financial and physical gas.  I directed him to Shari Stack, a lawyer in the  trade physical power.  They are aware that Credit is working on getting them  some headroom, and as soon as they counterparty comes out of Credit, we'll  get them approved to trade (pending resolution of physical power approval  from Shari).  If Credit could verbally let me know when they are approved I'd appreciate  it, so I'll know to look for them.  I will be traveling to Calgary Tuesday,  so I may be incommunicado while the plane's in flight, so that could possibly  hold things up.  	Mary Griff Gray 		  Here I am again --- The products that the customer desires is:  all types (financial/physical)  for gas and power.  What do you think? Thanks, Griff     	 	 	                            	 Guys, I received a call from Mike Garred, admin for The New Power Company, wanting  from our end.  What does this customer need to do to get credit? Thanks, Griff
