Mark, There has never been a time in our Group before where any member of our Group  was cut off from mass distributions that were sent to all of our client base  and member of the Group but me.  If the intent is to cut me off and make me  feel isolated from the Group and my friends, clients and customers and  associates it is working! Tanya Rohauer Does this mean you come of the list? We kept you on at your request even  though you were not drafting the docs. Carol St Clair Tana Jones will be spending most of her time working on special projects for  our group.  Please direct all credit work sheets to Marie Heard, Susan Flynn  and Susan Bailey.  Thanks. carol
