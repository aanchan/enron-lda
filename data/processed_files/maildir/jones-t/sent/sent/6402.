Just something I noted as I got in to approve Edison Mission.  West power was  also in the queue for approval.  We had previously had them approved for all  power, and Credit had shut them down for power because Credit has been  worried about their financial condition ala PG&E, but now is willing to open  them up for all power.  I thought it was OK to open them up for all power  since we had them open for all power before, but I just wanted to run it by  you just in case... 		 Ditto Credit.
