Can you please change the name of the corporation from "Inc." to  "Incorporated".  Thanks. 	Tana Jones 		 I'm with you on Montana.  I checked the files in the big file room, and it is  a Montana corporation. 		  It should read Energy West Incorporated, but our info shows that they are  headquartered and incorporated in Montana.  Please let me know if this  differs from your perspective; thanks. WG We have a master swap agreement in place with Energy West Incorporated, a  CANADA corporation.  Your list shows "Inc." instead of "Incorporated", and  that it is a US corporation.  Is this the same counterparty?
