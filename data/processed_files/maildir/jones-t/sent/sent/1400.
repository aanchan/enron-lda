John, you can take Shari Stack off these emails.  She is a lawyer working on  the physical power agreements, our group works on the financial trading  agreements.  Carol St. Clair is the lawyer working on this master (I'm a  paralegal).  Thanks. 		  ght? I believe this means only that we are not closing a deal today.  I would still like the contracts, please, in anticipation that we may yet do a deal.  cc:  right?  Clients are hopping up and down -- I am expecting a beer for my loyal  Enron services this week . . .   << File: pic11200.pcx
