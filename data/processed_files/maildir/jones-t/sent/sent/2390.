	Michelle Cash 		 I'd just do it going forward.  Thanks.  Michelle Leslie Hansen Michelle: Should we back date to date immediately after organizational resolutions or  just ratify past acts?  Preference? Leslie 	Tana Jones 		  ? 	Deb Korkmas 		 I will prepare Unanimous Consent electing Robert Jones.  What do we want to  use as effective date?  Please advise.  Thanks, Deb Deb Korkmas Enron North America Corp. ENA Legal Dept. 1400 Smith Street, Room 3819 Houston, TX  77002 Phone:  713-853-5448 Fax:  713-646-3393 	Tana Jones 		 Robert Jones appears to be a VP of Enron Net Works, but not EnronOnline.  By copy of this email to Deb Korkmas, I would like to confirm that the above  is correct, and if it is, can we please get Robert Jones added as a VP of  EnronOnline. Thanks! 	Leslie Hansen 		  Tana: Does Robert Jones, HR VP, have signatory authority for Net Works and  EnronOnline?   Per Michelle Cash, he needs it since he signs employment  contracts, ect.  If he does not, we'll need to have some retroactive  resolutions prepared. Please let me know. Leslie
