	Lisa Lees 		  fyi Dale Neuner Enron America de Sur S.A. is the enron entity set up to trade on EOL; Lisa  Lees will manage the external customer access. Dale: I spoke with Jeff Bluementhal earlier today and wanted to confirm the parties  that should be approved for trading Argentine.  The Enron party that should  execute Argentine physical gas deals should be Enron America de Sur S.A.  It  should be noted that all counterparties for this product should be Argentine  entities.
