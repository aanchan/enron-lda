Shari Stack I will leave this in your capable hands to sort out w/ MET.  Thanks! S Tanya Rohauer Shari, The correct S&P rating is BBB- and as Pat mentioned, we DO want to include as  part of the definition of Material Adverse Change if the counterparty ceases  to be rated.  Let me know if you have questions. Thanks, Tanya     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Tanya- I am sure that you noticed in the attachment that Shari has the trigger at  BBB and not BBB-.  In addition, do we want to add language in that section  that says an Event of Default also occurs if they are no longer rated by S&P? Regards, Pat Shari Stack Further to our meeting this past Monday, attached please find a proposal for  a Material Adverse Change Clause as an Additional Event of Default in the  ISDA Master Agreement.  Any comments or suggestions would be welcome.  Many thanks,  Shari
