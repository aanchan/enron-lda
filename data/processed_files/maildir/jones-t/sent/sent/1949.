	Janelle Scheuer 		  Hi Tana....here's the latest add'l info.  Can we get on this right away, so  hopefully we can execute a transaction on Friday.  Thanks. Janelle:  My Law people tell me we'll want to use the "Multi-Currency, Cross Border" ISDA with the NYPA version of the Confirmation (that I sent to you). In addition, they want New York law to govern not Texas law.  Re the guaranty,  we want to send you our draft on that account for your review and Hi Mike! A parent guaranty is no problem.  I'm attaching a copy, so you know what it looks like. We have a standard "long form" confirm ourselves, that is used until an ISDA is signed.  I attached a draft below so you could see it as well. We typically send these standard confirms to all our customers, so it may expedite things if NYPA doesn't have any aversion to this confirm.  What are your typical procedures? Would you accept our confirm, or should I go head and get our documentation people to get started looking over yours? Was the annual report on the web site sufficient, or would you like me to Fed-Ex one? Let me know what else can do.
