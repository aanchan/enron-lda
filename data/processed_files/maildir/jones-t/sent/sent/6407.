You are the best! 		  will do. j Limited Hi Tana Thanks for the note.....! I am looking for the original letter we signed with Glencore, but from my  recollection, all we said to Gencore was that the choice of law under any  master or other trading agreement between Enron and Glencore was unaffected  by the choice of English law under the UK PA or ETA.  This of course is not  quite the same as Glencore's view below! J Trades with Glencore Commodities Limited Tana -  Please see the email below - can you please look into Glencore's assertion that their EOL trades (vs. ENA) should be governed under English law.   Thanks, Diane 3.0443 Hi, I have received a call from Miriam in Glencore re EOL transactions.  Her  concerned are that she does not receive the confirmations within 24 Hours  (from Houston) of the deal being dealt which we are subject to in London and  she would like to see this from ENA.  Also, when Glencore agreed to trade EOL  transactions they stipulated that English law be used for all transactions,  presuming these would be the same from ENA.  She has tried to call but only  gets voice mail, could you please contact her to discuss these and any other  issues she has with EOL. Tel: 44 20 7412 3190 Regards, Debbie
