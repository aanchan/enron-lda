I think my bicycle is 52 centimeters.  I hope you have a tire pump, because I  don't and I haven't ridden the bike in about a year and I know the tires are  totally flat. 		  Tana Lou, I am back to bugging you about your bicycle.  Let me know when I can schedule a test ride.

I am still considering the MS 150 and wanted to know if your offer is still good for borrowing your bicycle.  If you have changed your mind, it is no big deal.  Promise! Patti
