I am forwarding to each of you the referenced assignment with respect to  physical trading and the online account.  I also called the company and got a  copy of the name change document they were referring to in the assignment. 	David P Dupre 		  Please check this for me when you have an opportunity, Thanks David  David  --- I gave this doc to Tana Jones (for Eonline trading).  It also  referred to physical deals, so she was going to pass it on to Debra  Perkingiere.   Call Tana - she can tell you where it is at.   Thanks!     (it  did not effect financial trading). 	David P Dupre 		  Could I have a copy of the assignment which I sent to you via interoffice  mail the other day for PPL Utilities?? I would be interested in picking this up from you if possible. Thanks David
