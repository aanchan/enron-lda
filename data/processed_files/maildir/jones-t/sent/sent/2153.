Mark, Mieco is the cpy where we had the misposted/bad online trade & we held up  their master.  Can we send it out? 		  It has been brought to my attention that the Mieco ISDA has not been received  by the company.  Could you let me know if there is any hold up or perhaps if  we need to trace the package?      Thanks Ed Sacks Ed, I thought Mary and I finalized our issues a week or so ago, but I haven't seen anything yet.  Maybe getting a signature?  Peter Peter, Hope all is well.  Wanted to make sure that the ISDA has been received by you.  My last recollection was that Mary Cook had agreed to all of your requests.  Please respond when you get a chance. Regards, Ed Sacks
