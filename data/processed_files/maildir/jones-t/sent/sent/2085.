I just got off the phone w/Derek.  I'll make sure someone handles it. 	Shari Stack 		  	 Here this is - can you please let Derek know you will handle?  Thank you,  S 	Derek Davies 		  Shari, I sent a copy of a standard short form agreement to encore.  They have sent  back comments.  Could you please review and get back to me.  We also need to  exchange C$10MM guarantees between Enron & Epcore. Derek Derek, we indicated we were reviewing your short form agreement.  Here are our comments.  We would like to set up a mutually convenient time to discuss them with you.  <<2909 - enron - shortform.doc Paul McMillan VP & General Manager 403.297.0347  - 2909 - enron - shortform.doc
