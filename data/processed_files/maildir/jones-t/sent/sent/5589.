Yes, Lucinda had a little girl last Friday by c-section.  She  was about 5  lbs 12 oz (3 weeks early).  Her name is Sophia Eleni.  Then my brother  Craig's wife had her baby on 1/9/01, a little boy name Daniel Francisco.  He  was 7 lbs, 12 oz.  Then one of the attys I work with had a baby, a little  boy, she lives around the block from me on Vassar, so a few of us went over  to visit her.  We had to cancel Lucinda's baby shower the night before it  because the baby was early. I'm a little afraid to go see Hannibal, maybe something a little cheerier...? 		  Miss Jones, You are always booked up.  I thought maybe you had disappeared.  Has Lucinda had her baby? A movie sounds good.  What did you have in mind?  Hannibal? cc:                     02/06/2001 04:53 Ms. Jones, I know you are working hard, but I needed to just check in and see how you are. Also, I just talked to Gale Ford, massage lady, and she said she will be working on Sat., March 3 in the afternoon.  I know weekdays are hard for you to make appointments and surely you are in need of a massage by now!!!! Let me know how you are when you come up for air!!   Patti
