	Lisa Lees 		  As you can see below, some of the ETAs have been forwarded to Travis.   Apparently, the others reside here, but only Frank knows where they are.  As  he's on a plane back to the US right now, I'll have to get these to you guys  tomorrow. Thanks.     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 FYI We do not have Australia, Bermuda, Chile, Japan & Peru - PCG Houston should  be able to help with those. Thanks Arfan --     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 I appreciate your assistance.  Could you please forward these documents to  Travis McCullough directly? Thanks, Jason Jason, As we discussed, please route the message below to the approriate IT person  to retrieve the ETAs referenced. Thank you. Travis needs to get copies of the ETA's below.  I don't know if there is  someone here in Houston that can get them for him, or someone in London.  I  usually would have called Edmund on this but he's out sick for awhile.  Can  you track it down for us?  Thanks!
