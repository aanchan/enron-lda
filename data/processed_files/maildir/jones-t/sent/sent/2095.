This seems like something the Confirmation Desk should do, or you.  I have  never dealt with the deal tickets before. 		  Can everyone meet tomorrow around 3-4pm to talk about SWAP Deals? If not  Friday, when would be a good time on Monday? Marianne Castano would like for  Paul to explain the Springs deal to us and have Tana show us how to transfer  the information to a Deal Ticket form. Thanks.
