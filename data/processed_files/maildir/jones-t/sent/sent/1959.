I would love to have the plants as long as they can take direct sun...can  they? Did you see on the news last night that they arrested 44 people for  participating in that pyramid scheme you were telling me about?  There's an  article about it in the KHOU TV website. 		  Thanks for the info.  I sent in my resume with a letter that they requested explaining how my experience would fit the job, plus salary requirements. Once again, I will keep my fingers crossed. Do you want plant/plants?? cc:                      09/20/2000  Thanks for writing back.  I could probably do the Saturday evening thing.  I  will let you know soon.  If you get a chance, check out Job No. 105738.  Know anything about it??  cc:                       09/18/2000               The name of the plant I told you about last week is DURANTA.     Think you will want it??                  That job I passed on your resume to in our group, I checked, and they   still    haven't started interviewing people yet, since Barbara is on vacation   dropping    her daughter off at college.
