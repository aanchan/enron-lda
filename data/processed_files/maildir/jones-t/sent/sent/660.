    	 	 	 Tana, No one here is working on revised confirms for BC Gas Utility.  All deals  prior to the execution of the Master are signed by BC Gas.  Do they want  these regenerated to show the Master Agreement template? Thanks, Joe     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Can whoever is working on the revised confirms for the referenced  counterparty let Doug know the status?  Thanks! My friends at BC Gas now have the ISDA amendment.  Thanks.  What about the  revised confirms?
