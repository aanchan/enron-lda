Per my conv. w/Carol St. Clair, Crestar commented on the ETA, but never  requested that their comments be formalized as an amendment.  Per our  understanding, they have not requested a signed amendment and opened the  counterparty w/o any changes, so we have not pursued them. 		  Tana, Can you confirm the status of the amendment with Crestar? Thanks, Dave Dave, I spoke with Carol St. Clair last week who told me that the ETA has been  worked out with Crestar.  Would you please confirm that for me before I call  them. Thanks. Lisa
