	Frank L Davis 		  Attached below is the Argentine customer list for EnronOnline.  My  understanding is that we will launch EnronOnline in Argentina within the next  couple of weeks.  With this in mind, I think we will have to shoot for the  end of next week (October 13) to have customer profiles completed.  Please  let Lisa Lees know of any conflicts or issues that arise. Thanks! Frank Frank, It seems now that we are going to proceed with Argentina. Therefore, I am  attaching the customer list. I am not sure if you already have it. Thanks! Leonardo Pacheco Patrick Hansen Esta es la lista que querias.
