Holly would be a good one to invite.  She and Carol are real good friends.   Lucinda really doesn't know Carol all that well, so I think I'd skip her.   Holly's work # is (281) 364-5207. 		  P.S.  I thought about asking Holly and Lucinda, but didn't know if they would be interested or not because of most of the people being the running group.  I would love it if they came.  Would you like to invite them, or, if you will give me their numbers, I would be glad to invite them. Thank you. cc:                     08/15/2000 Oh, I forgot to tell you something else: Carol Gradziel turns 50 today, but on Sunday  evening, August 20, we were going to do a surprise dinner at Buca di Beppo at  Buffalo Speedway and 59. I would love for you to come. It will be  the running group, mostly couples, and me and Carol. Everyone is supposed  to get there at 6:45 and we (Monnie, Ralph, and I are picking Carol up to be  there by 7. If you are not busy, try to come. Monnie and Ralph have  run with us, but they are the realtors that Carol does most of her business with  and I have known them for about 25 years.
