What do you think about the situation below? Susan Flynn       	 	 	 Pan Canadian Energy Services has the following request: For all EOL traded deals they do not want to recieve the Annex A that is  attached to our Omnibus-EOL templates.  They claim that since they have  already signed off on the GTC in order to trade on EOL, then they do not want  to repeat any work and have to review an additional GTC when we send them a  Confirmation.  Is it possible to exclude any Annex A (GTC) when we send an  Omnibus Confirmation for trades done on EOL? Thanks, Joe
