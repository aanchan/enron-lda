Louis, I went to fill in all that stuff, but they want to much personal information  (like my address and phone number which I don't like to give out) and they  won't accept the referral without it. 		  You Bet!!!! cc:                     any.com                     05/25/2001 Tana when you have a  chance could you do me a favor and go to www.contractor.com and do a search for  contractor by name then enter my name and then my company name will come up and  then click on the link to rate this contractor. Then fill out the form and rate  your favorite contractor and of course you must give me high  marks. How are you  doing? Louis
