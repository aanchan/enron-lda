Anita sent me the message below re: board resolutions to trade out of  Singapore.  Can Singapore trade out of the board resolution that was approved  for ECT Interntional, or are we going to have to get another board resolution  signed allowing financial trading out of the Singapore office? Anita Fam Hi Tana, Just to clarify .. the ISDA will be entered into by ECTRIC (S'pore Branch). Thanks for your help! Rgds, Anita Angeline Poon Hi Tana We have entered into an ISDA Master Agreement with Caltex Trading Pte Ltd.     As we need to put in place a proper resolution, could you please let us know  whether you have any standard board resolution template so that we may also  use it to pass the necessary board resolution? Thanks Angeline
