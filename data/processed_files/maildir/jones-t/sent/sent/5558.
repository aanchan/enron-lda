We have a RUSH approval for power trading for the referenced counterparty... 		  CMS Marketing, Services and Trading Company is currently closed for US East  reason as to why we should close them from trading this product, could we  please evaluate from a legal standpoint as to whether we could open them up  for this product?  Thanks. Walter
