All the counterparties below can trade physical, and only the two I've marked  below in red can trade financial. 		  Tana,  The counterparties below are about to be approved in Credit. It would be  great to get your Legal response before you leave for vacation.  We can then minimize approvals that go through Mark Taylor next  week.   Thanks, Camille Walter Guidroz I'm waiting on Tom to review my credit recommendations for the counterparties  below.  Once he approves these, I'll send them to you.  Thanks!
