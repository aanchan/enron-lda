David has sent us a memo re: Procedures for Approval to trade in Australia  that I think you will find helpful. Attached are the GTCs that I have revised to address tax issues that would  arise from counterparties with no Australia presence. I am content settlement  provisions already covered in the documentation. I have also developed a  checklist for new counterparties. Would you pass onto Chris Catt at PW for  his signoff.
