The critical documents are usually the masters and any guarantees issued.   Thanks for your help. 		  Tana,   I work with Jana Morse and our group is in charge of Australia. We have copies of Aussie ISDAs, which ones do you need?? And, what other additional info is required?? Thanks, Janie  (Embedded  image moved FYI cc: The Australia office gave me a list of their masters and I have entered them into the database.  We still don't have copies.  Further, I don't know more than if it's executed and the date.   They need to flesh out the additional information that is required.  - pic11478.pcx
