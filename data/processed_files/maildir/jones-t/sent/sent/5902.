Mike, I attempted to give Edmund Manager access by doing one of those security  requests today.  I don't know if you need to do anything or not here.... 	Edmund Cooper 		  Dear Michael, Following our conversation the other day I have spoken with Tana about  allowing me delete capabilities on the database.  Tana has kindly consented  to this so hopefully she has confirmed/will confirm this so that the  necessary technological changes can be made from your end. Many thanks, Edmund
