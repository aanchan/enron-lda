	Susan Bailey 		  Tana, I know you prepared the Grupo Calidra Deemed ISDA, so thought you should see  Joe's message. I am not familar with the particulars of the deal, but in the event they  and/or Enron were to furnish a parent guaranty, then you may need to find if  Joe received their Guaranty. Susan S.
