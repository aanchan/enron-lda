What do you think? 		  Tana, I sent the CDA to our legal team and they had a few changes to make. Can you make these changes and send it back? Regards, Dune Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Dune, I've reviewed the NDA and all of their changes are acceptable, except: --  The additions to the two sentences in Section 1 don't make sense as written, so should be restated as follows: Any written Confidential Information will be clearly labeled "Confidential Information" or, in the absence thereof, will be deemed Confidential Information if it is of such nature as should be known to the receiving Party to be confidential.  Any Confidential Information transmitted orally will be clearly identified as such by the Party disclosing such information at the time it is disclosed or, in the absence thereof, will be deemed Confidential Information if it is of such nature as should be known to the receiving Party to be confidential. --  We can't agree to the new language in Section 10. Feel free to forward my comments to Enron if you would like.  I would have revised the CDA accordingly, but they use a different redlining system than we do. Thanks. -- Best regards, Jane Akdoruk Senior Corporate Counsel 972-409-3104 Phone 425-699-0930 Fax Dune Thorne wrote:  Jane,  I left you a voice message regarding the attached NDA. We have been  working on a partnership with Enron for the past few months, and the  division of Enron that we have been talking to has moved into a  different group within the company. The attached NDA includes the  language of the new group. Could you review it before we sign it?  Thanks for you help.  -Dune  Dear Mr. Dune,  At the request of Dovie Keprta, I am enclosing our proposed form of  Non-Disclosure Agreement.
