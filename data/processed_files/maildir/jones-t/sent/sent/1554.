David, A clarification... On Ergon, Macxquarie Generation, Snowy and Citipower.  You say that they  should only trade Australian power and weather.  How about all the other  products, US, UK, Canadian physical and financial?  I am taking it literally  and not opening them up for ANY of the other products but those.  Is that a  correct interpretation? 		 Tana, thanks for expediting this Tana. The list for Australian weather is  fine. As I mentioned I will be following up with credit on the collateral  requirementsfor some counterparties. On Japanese weather I would suggest we  do not load up the following Ergon, Macquarie Generation and Snowy . These  are government power utilities and their ability to trade in products not  linked to their business is limited. Hence they should be only trading  Australian power and weather. Also I would ask that Citipower be restricted to Australian power and  weather. They are a Trust and the Trust Deed  grants the trustee the power to  trade devivatives to hedge its Australian power operations. I would like to  check this one out further.          Below is a RUSH list that we need to approve by the end of the day.  From the  US, the only response I expect will be from Leslie, with all declines for  power.  I NEED TO HEAR FROM AUSTRALIA TODAY ON THEIR COUNTERPARTIES. 	Frank L Davis 		  	 Attached below is a list of Australian and Japanese counterparties for the  Australian and Japanese weather launch.  As they are actually launching these  products this afternoon, your immediate attention would be GREATLY  appreciated.  Let me know of any potential conflicts ( other than the obvious  lack of time) and I will do what ever possible to help. Thanks for your extraordinary efforts!!!!!!
