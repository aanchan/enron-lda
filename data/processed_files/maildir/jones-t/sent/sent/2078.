It's no surprise to me to find Reggie's been stirring it up! 	Genia FitzGerald 		 You are both wrong, it is Reggie's fault, he told me not to hang around  either of you!!!!! 		 Yeh, you're right.  It is her fault.  In the past, she always had plans and  couldn't (or just didn't want to) go with us.  I guess that's the price you  pay for being so popular and in demand.

I guess we  need to make a date beforehand for lunch with you...! 		 Hey, I was an invited guest.  It wasn't my party!  Sounds like someone is  trying to weasel herself out of trouble.

Tana said it was YOUR  fault I wasn't invited!!!!! Genia 		  - Hotdog PHOTO2.jpg
