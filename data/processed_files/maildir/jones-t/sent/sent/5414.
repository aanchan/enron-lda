Please send the documents to me at EB3802.  Thanks! 		  If you were responding to this note earlier, Marilyn was asking if you wanted  to receive copies of all the documentation.  If so, please provide your  location. Hi Tana -  Cheryl Johnson has the document copies and will send you one. She is going to  start distributing copies as she updates the system instead of waiting for  the report sendout. If you want to be on the list, send her an email to be  added.  Marilyn I am being told that FirstEnergy Services Corp. is the successor by merger to  First Energy Trading Services Inc.  I do not have any documentation  reflecting this merger.  Do you?
