Derek, I think we just need to revise the header on the Chilean Annex to say "Annex  A-Chile".  When it was renamed, it wasn't renamed in the front of the  confirmation, so we just need to fix that glitch. 	Craig Breslau 		  Can you please help me to resolve this ASAP. Thank you, Craig I received from Derek Bailey the Confirmation Form  and the Chilean Annex,  but I feel there is still missing the Annex A, as it is  refferred in the  Confirmation Form as part of the terms and conditions of the  transaction.  Please confirm. ? Regards, Pablo Jaramillo ? ?
