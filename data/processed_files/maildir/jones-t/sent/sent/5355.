Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.   Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA  definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption  provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap  agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and  repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements. Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and  mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show  you any prior or new names for the counterparty.   If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I  will forward it to them. We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.
