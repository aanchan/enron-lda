Taffy, can you check Grant's list against our list of executed masters for  ECT Canada.  The Canada office is missing some of the masters we have in  place, and we have to provide them copies.  See me and I'll show you how to  do a sort on Lotus Notes to figure out what executed masters we show Canada  has in place, vs. the masters they think they have in place.  Thanks! Grant Oh Hi Tana, as per our conversation this morning here is list of counterparites  that we think we have ISDAs with. Please review and update at your convenience.  If there are any changes could  you please edit the file and return it to me?   If there are counterparties that we indicate as having no ISDA, could you  forward the appropriate documentation to Nella so that we have our files  current. Thank you very much. Grant
