It isn't clear to me whether you are on for this banquet tomorrow so I can  RSVP to Holly! 		  The one I have is the blue (deep purple) flower.  I think it is a new color. It has a little light orange fruit on it, hence the name 'Golden Dewdrop'. It is not really a big deal if you don't want it.  I was just offering it to you first because it is a neat plant. cc:                      09/21/2000  Thanks for the info.  I sent in my resume with a letter that they requested  explaining how my experience would fit the job, plus salary requirements.  Once again, I will keep my fingers crossed.  Do you want plant/plants??  cc:                       09/20/2000               Thanks for writing back.  I could probably do the Saturday evening thing.   I   will let you know soon.     If you get a chance, check out Job No. 105738.  Know anything about it??       cc:                        09/18/2000                        The name of the plant I told you about last week is DURANTA.       Think you will want it??                         That job I passed on your resume to in our group, I checked, and they    still     haven't started interviewing people yet, since Barbara is on vacation    dropping     her daughter off at college.
