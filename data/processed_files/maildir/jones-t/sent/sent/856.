Carol, will you handle this or Mark? Tori Kuykendall hi mark - i'm a gas trader on the west desk and one of my customers had some  issues with our electronic trading agreement.  the company is Arco Products,  adn their comments are on the attached file.  could you take a look at this  and give me an update.  thanks. Torrey, as promised I have attached ARCO's suggested revisions to the Enron online trading agreement. I look forward to working toward a mutually satisfactory agreement in this new and thorny area of e-commerce contracting. Dave (See attached file: ETA_revision0307.doc)  - ETA_revision0307.doc
