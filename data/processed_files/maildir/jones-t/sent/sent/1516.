Bill,  I looked, and you're not a VP of Enron Corp. either.  Maybe you need  to give Rick Buy a call so we can straighten this out... 	Deb Korkmas 		 Tana, my list shows he is with RAC (Corp) so I did not elect him to ENA.  Is  he supposed to be ENA?  Deb 	Tana Jones 		  Deb, Can you check the VP list for Bill.  He was promoted to VP of Enron North  America Corp. in January and, looking at the corporate database, his name is  not showing up on the list. Thanks!
