Susan Flynn 		   TANA CAN YOU HANDLE THIS?  THANKS! Susan D. Flynn Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB3806 Houston, Texas  77002 Phone:  713-853-0975 Fax:  713-646-3490 	Larry Joe Hunter 		  Susan, Can you let me know if we have a recent Assignment Agreement for the above  referenced Counterparty?  We are recieving Confirmations with the 'Electric  Utilities' crossed out of their name.   Leaving the name as PPL Corporation.   These are EOL deals, therefore we cannot change this to match them unless we  have done some Assignment Agreement that we haven't seen.  Let me know if you  know anything. Thanks, Joe
