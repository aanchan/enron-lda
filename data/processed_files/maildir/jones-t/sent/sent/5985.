I take it all the other counterparties on this list cannot transact power  since they are restricted by Credit... 		 Lubbock Power &Light to be limited to ERCOT products only since this is a  city in Texas and tenor limited to 3 months. Will re-visit if counterparty  and Enron wish to. I have spoken to credit who are comfortable with this. 		  		  Please see attached.
