You need to contact whoever it is you are speaking to at PPL and tell them we  have never received a request to assign the financial deals, and if they  would like to send us one we will take a look at it. 	David P Dupre 		  Hi Tana, I didn't know if I forwarded this to you or not, but they are indeed marking  up the financial deals Would you like for me to forward them to you? Thanks David     	 	 	 David, Make sure Tana knows that they are marking up the Financial Confirms.  The  Physical signoff does us no good. Joe David P Dupre FYI...I had already been talking to Tana about this. Since credit was working on it, I didn't provide a reply to you yet. David This is a consent to the physical business, not financial.  Stacy Dickson  will sign off on this as soon as she gets Credit approval, which it appears  she has not yet. 	Susan Flynn 		   TANA CAN YOU HANDLE THIS?  THANKS! Susan D. Flynn Enron North America Corp. 1400 Smith Street, EB3806 Houston, Texas  77002 Phone:  713-853-0975 Fax:  713-646-3490 	Larry Joe Hunter 		  Susan, Can you let me know if we have a recent Assignment Agreement for the above  referenced Counterparty?  We are recieving Confirmations with the 'Electric  Utilities' crossed out of their name.   Leaving the name as PPL Corporation.   These are EOL deals, therefore we cannot change this to match them unless we  have done some Assignment Agreement that we haven't seen.  Let me know if you  know anything. Thanks, Joe
