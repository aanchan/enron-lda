Link -- 	Laurie Mayer 		  Tana, would you be able to check on Mitsui Corp. ISDAs for us?  Thanks.  If I  can access the database please let me know. Laurie 		  Above company has approached us re an ISDA with them, they have also told us  that they have been negotiating ISDAs with Enron London and Enron Singapore  for some time. ************** Laurie/Nony, I wonder if you can find out for me from the data base, what the status is  with Mitsui Corp. ISDAs re all Enron companies?   *************** Alan, Mitsui Corp has hinted that it doesn't want to have separate ISDAs with  separate Enron entities.  What is Enron's usual approach to this I wonder.   Seems to me that from the customer's perspective, this makes sense.  I wonder  what sort of internal issues this raises though. ********************** Thanks all. Jane
