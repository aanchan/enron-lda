I've got the theater w/lucinda's mom on saturday.  How does fri night or  sunday sound to you? 		  Are all the moms, dads, and babies doing o.k.?  Aunts? I was just kidding about Hannibal.  What's on your mind? cc:                     02/06/2001 04:53 Ms. Jones, I know you are working hard, but I needed to just check in and see how you are. Also, I just talked to Gale Ford, massage lady, and she said she will be working on Sat., March 3 in the afternoon.  I know weekdays are hard for you to make appointments and surely you are in need of a massage by now!!!! Let me know how you are when you come up for air!!   Patti
