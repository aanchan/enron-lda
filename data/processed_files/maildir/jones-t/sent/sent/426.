    	 	 	 Tana, I have faxed to your attention some more issues with Tokyo-Mitsubishi  documents.  Toky-Mitsubishi has sent a fax requesting a few things be added  to our Confirmation.  The fact that the Master Agreement does not cover  Commodity trades is not one of their problems (see below).  However, there  are some Master related issues that they wish to have included in the  Confirmation such as Market Disruption Events, Disruption Fallbacks, and a  Non-Reliance provision.  As well as a couple of changes to our standard  language ('first nearby month' rather than 'prompt month'). Let us know what you think of their comments. Thanks, Joe Hunter Joe - The Master Agreement with TM does not contemplate entering into Commodity  Transactions. Confirms with this CP will require special language to be  provided by Legal. Please make a note in Special Handling and contact Legal  if any further trades comes down. Once we have the language, we will need to  revise the Confirmation for the trade done 10/15, and Bob will need to create  a special template for TM. Dale
