Alcoa Inc. has contacted us and would like to trade Aluminum online.  It  appears Frank was on this initial email.  I don't know what progress, if any,  has been made in getting the counterparty signed up online.  The person that  contacted us is on the bottom of this email.  I will wait to see this  counterparty come through on the Credit list.  P.S.  We do have a financial  master in place with them in and there is nothing in it that should restrict  metals trading.
