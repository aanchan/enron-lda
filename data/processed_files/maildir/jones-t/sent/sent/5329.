Dave, Per your conversation with Mark last week, it appears the Confirmation Desk  people are still waiting for the "oops trade" language. 	Larry Joe Hunter 		      	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 We never received any language from any EOL individual.  We have not  discussed revision language for EOL deals with Legal or EOL.     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Kevin, Is there some specific revision language that we've been given by the EOL  group for use with revised EOL deals? Legal is claiming that we should have received something long ago from  someone on the EOL side, but I don't recall ever getting anything. Thanks, Joe
