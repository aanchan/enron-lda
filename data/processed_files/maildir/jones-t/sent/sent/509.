Alan Aronowitz From the ENA Legal Emerging Markets Group's perspective, we see no issues  with these counterparties. Mark mentioned to me that you will be collecting  the Legal Dept.'s responses and forwarding our collective view to the Product  Controls Group. Thanks. Alan Rahil Jafry We need URGENT feedback on these counterparties as their trading contacts  within Enron have put the highest priority on them.  Credit has already  provided us feedback on them.  Please respond to Frand Davis and myself ASAP. Thank you and regards, Rahil x. 3-3206 Vitol SA Nicor Enerchange Helmerich & Payne Energy Services, Inc Ashland Specialty Chemical Company
