The bottom of this email will explain my email to Gaffer. 	Chris Gaffney 		  Tana - I am going to need the materials referred to in Greg's emails very  soon.  Is there a problem?  If so let me know, if not, please sent the  documents. Did you contact Steve Ashbourne at Blakes in Toronto? Regards CJG ps. How is your new pad working out? Greg Johnston Tana, I know we exchanged a couple of e-mails since the below about you  providing to me the Canadian financial trading precedents described below,  but I forget where it was left.  We do need to get these precedents to the  counterparty as soon as possible and I apologize for not following up on it.   As suggested, I need the actual base ISDA agreement, paragraph 13, credit  support annex, etc. as well as the short form financial GTC but I do not need  the municipal government schedule at this point.  Could you gather together  these precedents and forward them directly to Chris Gaffney in Toronto? Let me know if you need anything else from me. Cheers Greg Greg Johnston Tana, Enron Canada is currently negotiating a transaction with 6 major  municipalities in Ontario (the "G6") to provide various services to a company  those 6 entities are setting up, which services will include physical and  financial trading (both gas and electricity).  John Suttle is working with  Jan Wilson of our Toronto office to set the credit terms applicable to this  entity on both the physical and financial trading side, but they have not yet  made a final determination.  In the interim, the G6 has requested that we  send them a copy of our precedent form of master financial trading agreement  (both the ISDA and our short form financial GTC).  I assume you get requests  like this all the time and was hoping that you could e-mail to me (i) the  ISDA, credit support annex, Paragraph 13, etc. that we would typically put in  place between ECC and a Canadian counterparty to financially trade gas and  electricity in Canada (ie. incorporating the Canadian provisions), leaving  the credit terms blank for the time being and (ii) the financial GTC we use  for Canadian counterparties. Call me if you have any questions or if there are any problems with preparing  and forwarding these documents to the counterparty. Thanks Greg
