It looks like Mark has been working on this from out of the office.  Maybe  you don't have to do anything! 		 Richard - Thanks so much for providing the below document.  While I appreciate its  simplicity, it does not fully satisfy Enron's requirements.  If it is not too  much trouble, could you or Kenneth please provide comments to the agreement  provided. I will be back in my office on Wednesday and can address matters directly  with Kenneth or you at that time.
