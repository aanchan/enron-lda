I really don't know.  Maybe the icon, which is just a shortcut to the  database, won't work because of outlook.  I haven't had this problem with any  other people on outlook before.  You might want to talk to your computer  person.  He can probably find the database the long way.  It is just a misc.  Lotus Notes application. 		  Tana - I am unable to access the link for the Financial Trade agreements Notes DB.   I am wondering if my access problems are related to the fact that I have  outlook and the file is searching for the notes.ini link.  I'd appreciate any  assistance on this. Thanks! Angela Tana, Could you please email Angela Chen the link for the Financial Trade  Agreements Notes database?  Thanks very much!
