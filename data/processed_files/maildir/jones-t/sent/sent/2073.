Can you forward alison the template for an omnibus swap.  The attached  appears to be an EOL template. 		 The Confirmation I'm wanting is the other form you gave us which under  General Terms starts with "Notional Quantity per Determination Period". Do  you have it? Thanks. That's what I just sent you.... 		 Thanks Tana. Do you also have the Confirmation (SWAP) form that said "EOLID"?  I think that was the form we understood you to say was the "preferred" form.  Thanks again. The omnibus swap below, plus this Annex A make up the "omnibus" confirm. 	Larry Joe Hunter 		  Tana, Here's a Draft I had in my personal file.  I thought this would be easier  than deleting the coding from the system template Joe
