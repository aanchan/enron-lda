Keep me posted...have fun! 		  I am riding this weekend and will find out. cc:                     03/06/2001 02:46 Hey, FYI, I took your bike by Bikesport on Saturday and was going to leave it and the guy looked at it on the spot and said it looked to be in great condition. He aired up the tires and all I need to do is get on it and ride it!!! Thanks again. cc:                     02/26/2001 12:08 Morning, Glory, Hope you are doing well and had a good weekend. I am still considering the MS 150 and wanted to know if your offer is still good for borrowing your bicycle.  If you have changed your mind, it is no big deal.  Promise! Patti
