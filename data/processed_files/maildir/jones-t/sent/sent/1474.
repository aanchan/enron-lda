	Edmund Cooper 		  Tana,  could you do me a massive favour and arrange for the below referenced  ISDA faxed over to me. Thanks, Ed     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 Edmund, Gordon Boozer at Swiss Re has suggested that we use the existing ISDA Master Agreement between Swiss Re and ENA as a template for the EnronCredit.com Schedule.  Denis and I agree that this is a reasonable approach, provided that we carve-out any business / reps / credit terms peculiar to ENA.  I should be grateful if you would send me a copy of the ENA-Swiss Re Schedule by e-mail / fax (0207 330 9999) at your earliest convenience. Many thanks, James | (*) Normal | | ( ) High   | | [ ] Return receipt | 04/07/2000 14:40 Memo Priority: Edmund, Two further questions: 1.  Automatic Early Termination.  The Policies and Concessions Guidelines table indicates that AET should be applied / disapplied in accordance with the recommendations contained in the ISDA netting opinions, as summarised by the matrix recently provided to Enron by Cathy Ryan.  However, where the matrix indicates that AET is "Recommended", but is not "Necessary", what do you want us to specify? Please note that generally we think that Automatic Early Termination should not apply unless there is some legal advantage in including it (ie. where local counsel has indicated that it is necessary/strongly recommended in order to enforce close-out netting under the particular insolvency rules applicable to the counterparty).  This is because there are practical disadvantages associated with it.  The main disadvantages are: (a)  the fact that it cannot be waived by the Non-defaulting Party, which therefore loses its discretion as to whether and        when to terminate; and (b)  the risk that Early Termination will occur without the knowledge of the Non-defaulting Party. As  far  as  we  are  aware,  Automatic Early Termination is currently only necessary  in  relation  to counterparties located in Denmark. As a result, you  may  wish  to  consider  disapplying  Automatic  Early  Termination in relation to counterparties in all other jurisdictions.  Please note that we understand  that Automatic Early Termination is recommended (although it is not  necessary) for counterparties located in Singapore, Switzerland, Japan and the Netherlands.   As a result of these recommendations, you may prefer that   Automatic  Early Termination continues to apply.  Please let me know how  you  would  like  me  to  revert  to proceed in the first draft of the Schedules where AET is recommended, but not necessary.. 2. Date of the Agreement.  I should be grateful if you would provide us with details of the date of the first trade for each counterparty where EnronCredit.com Limited has an existing trading relationship with the counterparty.  If we have not received this information before the first draft Schedules and cover faxes are ready for distribution, then we will add these details in a later draft. I look forward to hearing from you.
