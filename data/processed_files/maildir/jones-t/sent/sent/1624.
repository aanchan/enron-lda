Bob, John Viverito, an attorney from Houston who is temporarily in Japan setting  up our Japanese trading office, is looking for the templates for  confirmations for US weather and pulp and paper confirmations.  Can you send  the confirmations to him.  Thanks! 	Alan Aronowitz 		 John: I will see what I can put together on this.  I will likely be able to line up OTC and On-line confirmation examples for US  weather (you, of course, can get Australian weather from David Minns) and  pulp & paper derivatives only, as metals and lumber are brand new to Enron  and are being developed as we speak. Regards, Alan Tana: Could arrange to have John sent by e-mail examples of the Houston  over-the-counter and on-line confirmations for weather derivatives and pupl &  paper? 		 Alan- Sorry for not being more specific.  Please have our form confirmation  documentation sent regarding these different commodities, so that we may  establish a form file here in Tokyo.  It is also anticipated that our  counterparties will be interested in reviewing the confirmations.   Thanks, John 		 John: It is my understanding that the ISDA documentation previously provided to you  and B&M is the documentation that we use for the other types of derivatives  you mentioned. Of course, the transactional confirmations are customized to  adopt the proper indices for the commodities being hedged. Alan 		  All- IBJ is interested in entering into a ISDA documentation with us for the  purposes of  trading weather derivatives, pulp & paper derivatives, oil  derivatives, lumber derivatives and metals.  Our credit department is now  preparing a credit work sheet, so that the relevant credit language can be  prepared.  I will contact B&M to discuss on Thursday. Alan- Please forward electronic copies of our standard documentation related to  pulp & paper derivatives, oil derivatives, lumber derivatives and metals (to  the extent there is any difference from what Marcus has already forwarded to  B&M), for the purpose of developing such documentation for the Japanese  market.   Cheers, John
