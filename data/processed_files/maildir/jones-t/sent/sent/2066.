See email below to John. 	Tana Jones 		 Enron Canada has a Master Agreement [ECT form, non ISDA] in place with Energy  West Incorporated (which ENA could trade under per the Services Agreement  with ECC covering financial trades only).  Per my conversation a second ago  with Credit, Energy West Incorporated and Energy West Resources are not  showing up in their records as being one and the same corporation.  Sounds to  me you need to call Credit for approval.  If we do not have a master, they  would have to get Credit approval to do a trade w/o a master in place. 	John Malowney 		  Tana, I am attempting to put together a "spark spread" with Energy West  Resources Inc. their current and correct business name.   I understand we  have an ISDA in place with Energy West Incorporated who is one and the  same.   In addition to credit concerns, is there any problem doing a  financial transaction with Energy West Resources Inc. under the name on the  ISDA of Energy West Incorporated ?
