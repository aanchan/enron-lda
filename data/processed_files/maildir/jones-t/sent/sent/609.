As a further to my previous email, the EOL Group will code the weather  transactions to fall under the financial master, and the Confirmation Desk  should confirm the weather trades under the current form of confirmation.     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Per my conversations with Bob Shults, Bob Bowen, Mark Taylor and Brant Reves,  we are going to open Aquila Risk Management Corporation to trade weather  under the EOL GTC's.
