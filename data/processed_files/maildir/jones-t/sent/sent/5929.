Done. Stephanie, if I asked Sam to make sure that this is done, could you do so?   Thanx. Cheryl Nelson Senior Counsel EB3816 (713) 345-4693 		  The above counterparty has been created in the Financial Trading Agreements  Database and is listed as a master swap agreement, and it's not.  It is an  Electronic Trading Agreement and needs to be moved down to "Other  Agreements".  Please let me know when that is done and I will delete the  entry in  the master swap agreement database.  Thanks!
