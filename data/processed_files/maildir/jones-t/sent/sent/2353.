Sounds to me like you don't need to worry about opening them up for power...! 	Leslie Hansen 		 Tana: ANP Power Marketing Company is NOT a current counterparty and is not on my  list of FERC approved sellers of power.  Thus, this counterparty is NOT  authorized to trade US power.  (It sure sounds like a power marketer.  They  are free to call me to discuss if they are FERC approved.) Leslie 	Tana Jones 		  The above counterparty should be coming on tonight's list.  We would like to  open them for gas ASAP, and Credit is reviewing the financials now to give  them some headroom on power.  If you could let me know ASAP whether you have  any issues.
