Shonnie Daniel Mark,   Attached is a revised memo.  The memo previously forwarded defined Bridgeline  exclusive customers as those connected to interstate pipelines.  The correct  definition of Bridgeline exclusive customers are those connected exclusively  to intrastate pipelines.  I'm sorry for any confusion.  Please destroy any  copies of the previous memo.  Thanks.  Shonnie 	Shonnie Daniel 		 Mark,  Attached is a memo setting forth the customers/facilities that are included  in the Bridgeline non compete agreement.  Please call with any questions.   Shonnie 31463 		  Shonnie,  Scott Neal gave me your name as someone who might be able to provide me with  the list of customers that are "off-limits" to ENA to provide physical gas to  via the Bridgeline agreement.  If you could email me that list, it would be  helpful.  Thanks Mark Smith Manager 3-6601
