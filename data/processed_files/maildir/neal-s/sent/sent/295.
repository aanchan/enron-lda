    	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Scott, Dayton Power answer to your high demand question in the morning meeting today. sg Steve, Would you believe it's cold-weather driven????  They're forecasting average temps up here of 58 on Thr, 54 on Fri, and 55 on Sat.  Jeanette and I both believe that the demand forecasts are way too high.  Hopefully our gas control will knock these forecasts down a little. Darin  Darin,  What's driving the high demand forecast into your system for the next five  days?  It doesn't look like terribly high temps in your area.....not weather  driven is it?  sg
