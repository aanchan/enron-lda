please find out what dates are available for this program, I need to attend  some time before year end. David W Delainey Folks, you are the remaining officers of ENA that have not yet enrolled in  this mandated training program.  It is ENA's goal to have all its officers  through the program before the end of calendar year 2000.  The course has  received very high marks for effectiveness.  Please take time now to enroll  in the program. Speak to your HR representative if you need help getting  signed up. Regards Delainey
