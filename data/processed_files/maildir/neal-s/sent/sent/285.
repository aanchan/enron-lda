Saludos Julian Poole Argentine Power Market update: A series of sabotage acts occurred last Tuesday, putting the whole Argentine  other lines went down as well, all in the Comahue-BsAs corridor. All 3  incidents were due to sabotage acts, in which the tensiles holding the high  tension towers were sawed. Nuclear plants suffered technical problems and kicked out 640 MW. This situation created a huge swing in the frequency of the system and an  overload of the 4th line from Comahue, which finally went out of service as  well at 1:30 am, and was out of service for 1 hour. This last event kicked  out the exports to Brazil which were at 1040 MW. As a result of all the above power prices reached $170 per MWh during 11:00  Transmission lines are expected to be re-established by Saturday. For who might be interested, below is a detailed document and map showing the  sequence of incidents and the damages caused (in Spanish). Julian
