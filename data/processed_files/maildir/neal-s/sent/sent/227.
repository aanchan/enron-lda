Wildcats: The Lions could only field a team of 9 players for the game Saturday and we Sunday, October 22 at  4:30pm Unless there is an overwhelming negative response to the change, I will advise the league in the Friday morning that we will agree to the schedule change. So, if you are opposed to the time change please call me before 8am Friday, at: 281.541.1878. Thank you.
