James is a neighbor and  good friend of mine.  He and his wife went to school  with my wife.  Although I have never worked with James, my view is he is a  marketer/originator/business developer.       	Enron de Mexico 	 	 Scott: Thanks fo the lead.  Just a couple of quick questions: (1) How well do you  know James?  (2)  Depending upon your answer to #1, what type of role would  you see him playing in an ENA group? Hope all is well.
