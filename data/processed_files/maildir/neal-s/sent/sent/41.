i can;t get my e-mail to go to conrad, so here we go. i have replaced the window that conrad cloud broke to get in the house. i also washed all the slip covers, as he had a dog in there with him. i don;t know if he is out of jail or not at this time, i have not seen him. will continue to keep a close watch on the house.  barry Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com
