Thank you, Russel Diamond Due to credit exposure to Mieco, we have shut them down for trades, with the  exception of physical gas purchases.  We need to notify the gas desk to  purchase daily physical gas at index to help offset our exposures (ENA  purchases only).  Please call your respective trade desks (gas, power, crude,  coal, weather, etc).   Ed Sacks
