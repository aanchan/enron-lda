David, I think maybe clarifying "then go to the transaction search" with something  like " then click on the Transaction History tab at the top of the screen"  might be  helpful.  Message as discussed. David Forster Jay, Here is the current communication error message: Can you please replace the above paragraph as follows: "YOUR TRANSACTION MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL due to a communication  failure." "To confirm whether or not your transaction was successful, please try to  login again and use the "Transaction History" function to see a list of all  your completed transactions. If you have any questions or are not certain of the status of a transaction,  please contact us immediately on:" Thanks, Dave
