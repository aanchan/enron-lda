please correct per your calculation Scott: Origination was granted to Robin last night for $468.  However, I wanted to  bring it to your attention that sitara  #618541 and 618626 are two day deals  and my calculations show that $708 may instead be the correct amount of  origination.  Please correct me if I'm wrong or let me know if I should grant  to Robin an extra $240 tonight.     Thanks, Alejandra
