Have we made this available to the Cheney team? Here's the Opinion Elite file.  It looks very strong for our open access  argument. Suggest we update the WH.  Any other uses?  I have the verbatims and cross  tabs.  We'll send a sanitized version (although there's not much I wouldn't  want everybody to see) to some of the interviewees who requested it. Mark 		  Enron Team: A draft of the key findings of the opinion elite survey is attached. We are sending out hard copies tonight so you should have them tomorrow morning. Thanks.
