There is also a california update call (used to be daily, now weekly).   Marcia Linton (Jim Steffes' assistant) can give you the call in information  and add you to the distribution list. 		 Steve, I just added Shirley this morning, and I am forwarding her the articles that  I distributed earlier today. 		  please include shirley on your california updates 		  You mentioned at the end of our conf call last week that there might be an  internal distribution I should be on.  Is there someone I should contact to  get on the list?
