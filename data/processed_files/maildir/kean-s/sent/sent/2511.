You have probably heard this already, but on July3, the CPUC postponed their  direct access decision until mid-August. You may want to forward this to your customers. The California Chamber of Commerce received a call from someone at the CPUC who requested that they send as many customers as possible to testify at Tuesday's hearing in favor of direct access.   The Chamber has requested the same thing of Enron.
