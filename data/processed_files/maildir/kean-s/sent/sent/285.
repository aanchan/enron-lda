	Enron Energy Services 	 	Phone No: 713 853-7413 	 See below.  VEPCO  intends to challenge the USMDW privatization.  More  details to come. I have scheduled a meeting with Larry Adams, the Asst. U.S. Attorney, and  that VEPCO has told him that it plans to file a challenge to the GAO's  decision in the Court of Federal Claims this week.  I have also spoken to  Andy Holloman;  we will call him from the Venable office for a "download" on  the Colorado case. Ideas on D.C. counsel?  V&E or Venable are the logical choices;  offhand I  would propose V&E.
