Fine Richard Shapiro Can we change- I'm not opposed Rick: During the early performance review, Germain Palmer had been placed in  the satisfactory classification because of the need to reach the goals now  not being applied by our division. Germain is definately a "strong" and  rising employee in this office and I would like to recommend his rating as  "strong." Germain has been a God send this summer and we all greatly value his  contribution in Washington. Thank you for your consideration of this request. Joe
