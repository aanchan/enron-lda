fyi 		 I am meeting with Mike on 2/27. I will feedback after that. Regards - Dan I know you guys have been working around the clock.  I just wanted to make  sure you hadn't forgotten about Mike Dahlke (whose resume I sent on to you  Dan).  When you catch a breath please take some time to consider Mike for EES.
