Let's process this request.  I think it's justified. Richard Shapiro Please call on Wednesday to discuss so we can bring to closure. Thanks. Sandra McCubbin I am in complete agreement with you..this was for a total of $150 and was  given at the request of a powerful woman senator, who is the sponsor of this  program..if it had been for more money I would have not have contributed, but  the 17 women members that were there are of importance to us.
