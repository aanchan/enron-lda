No, I had the right date from our previous communications. Nicholas O'Day I have noticed a fairly significant typo in the note below. The correct date  for the key note address is 26 October, as set out in my first note. Did that  impact on the issue of availability?    Nicholas O'Day Ken Lay Visit. Following discussions with the Prime Minister's office and a  quick check with venues 31 October is firming up as the preferred date for a  Jeff Skilling Visit. The Nikkei and the Tokyo University have now made the  decision to invite Mr Skilling to give the key note address at the symposium  on 26 November in Tokyo. As mentioned, the symposium is the most prestigious  conference on IT in Japan. While the conference itself receives significant media attention, the  President of Nikkei has offered to interview Mr Skilling. This honour is  usually reserved for Heads of State. The interview will be featured on the  front page of the Nikkei and picked up by other major media services. kind regards        Nicholas O'Day Ken Lay Visit. Balancing the need to push out the arrangement of high level  meetings as far as possible with the desire to have a meeting with Prime  Minister Mori prior to the US Presidential election, the week commencing 30  secretary first thing tomorrow morning Tokyo time.  Jeff Skilling Visit. The boards of Nikkei and Tokyo University Institute of  Advanced Studies have yet to make a decision on the key note speaker for the  one day invitation only seminar to be held on 26 October. As mentioned, the  boards will choose between the chairman of Cisco and Jeff Skilling. The  conference is focused on the IT revolution and an invitation only event for  approximately 600 of Japan's corporate leaders. The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key  note speaker. If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech, it is likely  that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the  seminar.  Following the Prime Minister's commitment at the Okinawa summit of  US$15billion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education,  Japan's focus on e-commerce is almost reaching fever pitch. There will be  significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and  the business community. Further, as you would expect with the involvement of  the Nikkei, there is typically significant media coverage associated with the  key note speaker's presentation. kind regards
