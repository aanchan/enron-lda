Joe - could you or someone in the office get in touch with Michelle?  Thanks 		  Steve,  As mentioned in my voice mail, attached is the email from SHRM about the  proposed amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act.  I believe that this  legislation would be helpful to Enron.  Let me know if I can do anything to  help. Thanks.  Michelle Drew C Lynch Brian / Michelle, I would take this as good news!! DCL     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 HHRMA members Lori Thomas and Lane Transou shared findings from the Legislative Action Committee's FLSA-bonus survey (presented at September's meeting) last Friday in Washington, D.C. with representatives of several influential members of Congress. Pending legislation (sponsored in part by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison) would permit non-exempt employees to participate in bonus programs without employers having to recalculate overtime rates. Congress is ready to act. President Clinton may be willing to sign. We need your help. Please consider calling/e-mailing members of both houses, especially Phil Gramm, Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL), and Houston area Congresspersons Ken Bentsen, Bill Archer, Sheila Jackson Lee, Nick Lampson, Tom DeLay, Kevin Brady, and Gene Green. Contact information is at http://www.visi.com/juan/congress/. SHRM has sample  E-Mail wording at http://cw2k.capweb.net/shrm/letterstate.cfm under "Bonus  Legislation-House Version" and "Bonus Legislation-Senate Version." If  possible, please copy President Clinton on your communications as well.
