fyi Joseph P Hirl Steve, Thanks for your voice mail the other day.  Your memo certainly helped in  better understanding the situation.  Locally, we have not seen any additional  articles on CA or on dereg, but will let you know if we do. I will also take  onboard your other comments.  I speak with Mark tomorrow to go over Nick's  review. thanks, Joe
