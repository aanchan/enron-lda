Please get the list of people I interviewed (and their resumes) from Allison  Bailey and confirm with her that if the attached spreadsheet shows a "y" next  to their name that means they received an offer (if "n" then no offer).  I  would like to email those i interviewed who recieved offers 		  Please call or e-mail candidates who have received "offers".All of your hard  work paid off - you have a great list of "offers".  These students have all  been called and will receive a letter/packet by the end of the week.
