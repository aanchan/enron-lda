Mark Koenig Steve and Mark - FYI.  I would prefer not to state that Pug is on our Finance  committee, and the reference to Enron's stake being substantial.  I will call  Diane and let her know.  I assume Jeff and Ken and Pug will get a chance to  approve this.  MEK 	 Attached are the latest documents.  We plan to issue the release at 8 a.m.  CDT tomorrow.
