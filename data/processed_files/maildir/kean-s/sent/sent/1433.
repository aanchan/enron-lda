could you look into this for me? Richard Shapiro 	 Regarding voicemail I left you regading my current compensation, I  do not  intend to bug you about this, but at some point, I would appreciate knowing  whether my  base compensation ( and stock compensation  given recent price  movements )  are set at the appropriate level, in relationship to peers in  public affairs, company, and externally. Thanks.
