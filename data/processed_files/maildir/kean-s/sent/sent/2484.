I know we are holding for a later filing, but I have attached further  comments anyway.  The document is still too rough to send out.  We need to  take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly  researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners.   California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC  (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California  politicians can be.  We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of  that realization.  We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations  at the Commission, the Hill and the media. Linda Robertson Let me emphasize that these comments are to be filed COB TODAY.    	James D Steffes 		  HERE IS THE MOST RECENT STATEMENT WITH STEVE'S COMMENTS. Jim
