Check schedule and if I can go please rsvp to Ruth Ann 		  Mark Palmer and I would like to celebrate three well-deserved promotions by  gathering  the three of you and a date of your choice with a few good  friends( that's you folks on the cc: list and your dates of choice) for  dinner at my house.  Since I don't cook well, some might say "at all" , Mark  has gratiously offered to do the honors-- I will provide the venue and the  wine (that I can do.)  The date we have chosen is Friday,February 9 and the  time is 7:00 p.m. The location is in River Oaks at 2910 Del Monte (the corner  of Del Monte and Kirby).  The attire is casual.  The evening is guaranteed to  be FUN. Please let me know as soon as possible if you can join us. Thank-you.  Beth Tilney
