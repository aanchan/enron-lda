Additional information on the regulatory context. Richard Shapiro Richard Shapiro Enclosed is revised regulatory " issues" memo that  served as the basis for  discussion at yesterday's regulatory  review  meeting--- the only outstanding  issue , as I just communicated to Charles Still at Skadden, is confirmation  of  the fact that there are no antitrust approvals required in South Korea  relative to SK- that confirmation should be forthcoming from local counsel  this evening.  Lisa- I assume you will see this gets to Bill Gathmann  immediately so he can  forward on to regional general counsel for final  sign-off.  Rick, please find attached clean and marked versions of the regulatory issues memo.  <<Regulatory Issues.DOC  <<compare 4v2.DOC  - Regulatory Issues.DOC  - compare 4v2.DOC
