		  	 Sorry to bring more to you but perhaps this is something that Rob Walls could  easily look through.  Global has a contract that is ready for signing.   Global is involved as an investor in Razorfinish.com.  The person who is  supposed to sign the contract is procrastinating as long as possible bec ause  the contract is not in the interest of Enron.  I told the person not to sign  it regardless of the pressure from Sanjay.  Hopefully, Rob could get to it.
