ditto -- nice work Rob.  Your insights on project stanley are also much  appreciated. Richard Shapiro Your work on the  Alberta PPA has not gone unnoticed and really is a  model  for the rest of the group as to how to approach the review and analysis of  a  significant transaction w/ huge reg. risk-  the thoroughness and quality of  your work were top notch as was the teamwork you exhibited thoughout the  process..... not to mention the external leadership you provided on the issue  w/ folks like Larry Charach. Thanks very much!
