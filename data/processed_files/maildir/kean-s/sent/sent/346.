I don't know.  Can we get someone in IT to respond? 	Mary Clark 		  Steve, I believe the answer is that we don't mandate a specific format for  dates for all locations but rather use what is done locally -- just like this  employee's recollection.  Do you agree? Mary Richard Causey Mary, Rick is on vacation and I am monitoring his email.  This question has  come up before and we sent it to Philippe Bibi.  It is a computer question. Mary Clark Rick, can you prepare a response to this question for Ken, Jeff and Joe?  If  you're not the right contact for this, do you know who is?  I need a response  by Aug. 3.  Thanks. Mary Dear Ms. Clark, Here is my question: Would you allow our staff and customers to vote on Enron adopting the  International Standards Organization Specification for formatting dates (i.e.  "YYYY-MM-DD")? Please let me know if you would like me to send you a list of the many  advantages in using the ISO standards. I asked Ken Lay this question a few years ago, but he thought we should use  local customs; however, as we are becoming more international and more  internet-based, the ISO standard is becoming more advantageous. Thank you, Dave Fabian
