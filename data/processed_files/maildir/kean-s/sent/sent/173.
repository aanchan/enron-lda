FYI Just happened to pick up from a third source that Shantanu, Principal  Correspondent in Delhi of 'The Telegraph' is doing  a story today about the  arbitration. So far he has not called in for our participation and I am  refraining from being proactive. While the eastern centric  'Telegraph'  is  Calcutta's largest daily, we can expect further pick up thereon with possible  media querries tomorrow onwards. As advised, I will forward such querries to  John Ambler.  Jimmy
