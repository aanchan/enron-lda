I think the presentation looks good.  In the meeting itself I think you  should go heavy on the argument that it makes no sense for Sempra  shareholders to be in a commodity market as a regulated entity -- the "heads  they win tails you lose" argument. 	Jeff Dasovich Attached for your review is a rough cut at slides we're preparing for the  meeting with Sempra next Thursday.  Thoughts and comments are appreciated.   Please disregard korny title.
