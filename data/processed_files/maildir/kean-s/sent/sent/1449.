Tell him we are sending his note on to the appropriate person. MARY  CLARK         Steve, I need your help in responding to this question.   Mary     	 	 	 Anonymous Since Enron and EBS are trying to cut costs and be more cost effective, why  would a vice president need an executive computer setup at home?  Especially  if they already have a laptop (provided by Enron)  they take home every night  and have taken advantage of the Click at Home program as well.  Since Enron  has gone through the expense of giving each and every employee the  opportunity of the Click at Home program, it seems to be a somewhat redundant  expense of which I might add is unnecessary in my opinion. I feel it would behoove ALL EMPLOYEES, including executives, to be more  conscientious of costs and expenses to improve Enron's and EBS' bottom-line.   How can we ("Enron") be a world leading company if we don't have leading  world leaders that spend Enron's money as if it were there own. I think it would be in Enron's best interest to set some guidelines regarding  expenses such as these.  Just because a person is an executive of the company  why should be allowed to have anything they want just because they can? Thank you for your time and the opportunity to express myself.  Especially  since I am a shareholder also and care where the money goes.
