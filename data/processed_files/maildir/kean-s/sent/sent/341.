Isn't our primary problem with AEP's internal merchant function rather than  with the marketing affiliate (I realize we have problems with the affiliate  too)?  Can we protest continued market based rate authority for AEP until  they have surrendered native load priority? 		  to continue market based rates for power marketing.  The filing includes  examples of discriminatory behavior on OASIS (for ATCs, etc.) that  potentially benefitted AEP's marketing side.  this year, and plans to protest other large utility-based power marketer MBR  filings this fall.  Let me know if you would like the list.  Thanks. ** High Priority ** Christi - Attached is the final filing in word.  I also sent you a hard copy on Friday.  - aep.doc
