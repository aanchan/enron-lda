Linda - I haven't heard of these guys.  Do you know them?     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 Steve and Mark, a good friend of mine works for Mr. Grimes at Stewart &  Stevenson.  They have been offered this opportunity by the China Assoc. for  Social and Economic Development for a commitment of $74,000.  Since Mr. Lay  has been a past recipient (according to their attached letter), they are  wondering if this is legit.  Can you provide any insight?  Thanks for your  help.  SRS Hi Sherri,  We would be most appreciative if you can help us out on this one!  Our President and CEO, Mike Grimes, received the letter (copy attached/please  open) from the China Association for Social and Economic Development.? In  this letter, Mr. Wu mentions that Dr. Kenneth Lay was a past recipient. Well, you just called - so I won't complete this email!  Love you -  Doyleene  ?   <<~MAP0000.jpg     - ~MAP0000.jpg
