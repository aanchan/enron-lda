Accurate and sobering.  I've made two small comments just as an fyi. 		  Here is a draft of the article we discussed.  It is rather benign - but I would appreciate it if you would take a look.  Let me know if you have any reaction.                     Bob Edwards Article Attached is an article that we have drafted with the help of a McK Quarterly editor.   We have set up a call for tomorrow at 10:00  (CST) in order to talk through the article and the implications to our clients.  We have received very good and constructive comments from many of you which we have tried to incorporate (as much as a 750 word limit would allow).  We believe we have a shot at a Monday op-ed piece in the WSJ if we send this out Friday.  The events of today highlight the timeliness of this issue. Looking forward to talking to you tomorrow.
