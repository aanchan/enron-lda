	Karen Denne 		  fyi, the attached release which mentions PGE as one of six utilities forming  an independent transmission company is scheduled to be released today. As Kregg mentioned on the communication conf call today, here's the final draft of the release on the Independent Transmission Company that will go out this hour. It will not have a company letterhead. Regards, - Mark
