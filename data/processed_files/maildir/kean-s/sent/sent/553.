Maureen please check my calendar 		       Dan & Steve,               This meeting is scheduled to be held on Friday 1 December at       McDonalds Headquarters in just outside of Chicago. People are flying       in Thursday night and we plan to go through most of Friday - maybe       with a tour of Hamburger University. The participants are General       Motors, Dupont, McDonalds, NASA, and hopefully Enron. I will be       traveling on Tuesday, but could we arrange a time to discuss this on       Wednesday?            Rick Jones
