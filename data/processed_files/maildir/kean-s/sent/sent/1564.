fyi - Jade Eaton is one of Lara's contacts at DOJ 		 Steve, Thanks for forwarding.  Actually, Brian sent it to me on Monday, and I  followed up with Ann and Barbara.  I have not spoken with Brian yet because I  am waiting for a green/red light from Barbara as far as Jade Eaton is  concerned.  Barbara and I spoke at length yesterday and she is concerned  about the counterparty's reaction to a meeting with DOJ (even an informal  one).  She plans to get back to me though with regard to whether they want me  to get involved at this stage.  I spoke to Rick as well so he is up-to-date  with the current status.   I'll let you know if anything further develops.  Thanks again. Lara  		  		  Please find the attached status update for the HPL transaction.  If you have  any questions please contact me. Thanks, Brian
