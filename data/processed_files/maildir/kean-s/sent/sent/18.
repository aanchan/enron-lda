Please respond and copy me. Steve, look, I am just trying to get a complete explanation of why NEPCO can  not bid during the competitive process for the Cayote II Project.  Can  someone give me an adult level explanation?  I would appreciate it.  Thanks.  LI72399 Harrison CC:  Pamela Lesh;  Walt Pollock I think Paul Kaufman made the call on this from Steve Keanes' shop. I think it was the right call, given the complexity of the regulatory issues Importance:  High Peggy, we had wanted to add NEPCO to the bid list of bidders for the EPC bid for the Cayote II Project.  Greg Piper has informed me that PGE is of the opinion that we cannot even have NEPCO participate in the bid because PGE does not think that would be able to get by the regulators. Before accepting this as fact, can you confirm that we can not even  participate in the bid process because NEPCO is an affiliate of Enron.  It  seems that the best interest of the rate payers is in getting a winning  competitive bid.  Are affiliates precluded from competitive bids in this  process? Again, I don't want to accept a no without insuring that it's absolutely  necessary.  Thanks for your help. LI71299
