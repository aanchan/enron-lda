	James D Steffes 		  FYI.  Jane is doing a great job supporting the Reg Risk efforts. JDS Just had a preview meeting with Wade Cline and Neil McGregor (Pres. of DPC).   They are very supportive of the effort and felt that, while "Jane, you always  bring us such good news!" that the depth of analysis and real time concerns  articulated was an excellent thing for the company.  In fact, they wanted a  few more mitigants put in and then shot down, anticipating Jeff Skilling-type  questions.  Thus, this regulatory risk idea if done in depth for each  region/project, may be a bigger service for Enron than you guys had ever  anticipated.  They also thought of one more tack to take on the renegotiation  issue to figure out how far we could go.  Good deal.  (However, will still  wear body armor/butt plate into the Sanjay meeting next Wednesday).   	 	John Neslage 	 	 Thank you for staying so on top of this, Jane.  I really appreciate it.    John Jane Wilson 	 They're working on the numbers, but it will be ugly.
