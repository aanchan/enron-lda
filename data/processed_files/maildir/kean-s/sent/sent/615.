It is tenure at the level (eg vp or MD) not with organization.  The color  scheme looks good. 	Gina Corteselli 		  I sent before i looked at the distro of this message - so sorry, G     	 	 	 all; Attached are the screen shots to give you an idea how the red/green color  coding for rating movement from mid year ratings will appear on the screen.   Is this more of what you had in mind?   Let me know what you think.  G Also, can you please confirm my understanding that the tenure color coding is  TENURE AS A VP (AND MD?) and not tenure in the organization?
