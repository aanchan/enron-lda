The plan was to hit the issue twice -- once in the short format of Ebiz and  at greater length in the longer format of the October issue of Enron  Business.  Please let Paul know. Elizabeth Linnell Just as a matter of interest, I looked up this guy and he's in London, not in  the US. I understand that there is a longer, more involved piece coming out - don't  know where exactly.  We need to respond to this guy with that info.   		  FYI -- seems that employees want more info.... Not so good PAC feedback...   "Everything You've Wanted to Know About Enron and the Presidential Campaign  But Were Afraid to Ask" ????? Far from everything! Your "Where the money is spent" section tells us nothing about specific  contributions to the Election 2000 campaigns, nor Soft money corporate  donations to things such as party conferences. Scared of alienating employees?
