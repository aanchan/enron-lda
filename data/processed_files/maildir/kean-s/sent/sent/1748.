calendar 	Lisa Connolly 		  I have confirmed the Houston Fire Chief Selection Committee News Conference  for Febr 1, at 2pm. I will forward the specifics as soon as they have been  worked out. Lisa We have rearranged the Mayor's schedule to hold the Houston Fire Chief Selection Committee News Conference on Feb. 1 at 2 p.m. Why don't we have lunch sometime next week to coordinate? Importance: High Hi Monette, Regarding the press conference on the Houston Fire Chief selection committee, I have only two possible dates that will work with Jeff Skilling's calendar. February 1 is the preferred date, anytime after 1:30pm. Alternatively, February 2, anytime between 1:30pm and 3:30pm. Let's touch base tomorrow and try to pencil in a date for the press conference. Also, I don't have contact information for you... Thanks, Lisa
