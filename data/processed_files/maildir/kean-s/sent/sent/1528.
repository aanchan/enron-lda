Please post on internal site 		 Two documents: First is the external document we faxed to certain reporters. This is what Steve is referring to. Second is the talking points which reflect all changes to date. I am waiting legal approval - which I'm expecting any minute (I emailed Mike Smith your changes last night).    We should put both on website as soon as I track down Mike or Vicki.  Thanks, Peggy     Peggy -- My understanding is that you and Steve Kean finished these talking points.   Can I please get the final copy? Jim 		 could we have this finalized by tomorrow am...also, understand CSU issued  press release,  could we see it asap..thanks
