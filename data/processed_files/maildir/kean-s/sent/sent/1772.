I don't think this will work.  We have offices on 50M but two are set aside  for board members and one (the one Rob Walls recently left) is going to be  tied up with a video crew working on the analyst meeting. 	Maureen McVicker 		  Steve - is this ok with you? 	Sharron Westbrook 		  I left you a voice mail message earlier today, but let me tell you what we  need to know.  Rick Causey is moving Melissa Becker to a new role within his  organization and needs to have her close for at least the short term.  We  know that there is an office empty on 50M and we were wondering if we might  use it for Melissa until we work out some other spaces issues.   Thanks, Sharron
