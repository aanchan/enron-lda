We don't have revised versions yet.  when we do, we will probably only want  to put some (not all) of the documents on the intranet. Have we received the newly revised principles, facts and statements for the  Luntz Focus Groups? I was hoping to place these on the California power issue  database.  Thanks, Gavin Maureen McVicker Hi Steven,  Attached is the first of four documents that we have prepared for the focus groups.  All of the exercises are works in progress and I am sending them to you for comments. (Hopefully, we are on the right track.) As we discussed, I am happy to fly down to Houston tomorrow so that we can review these materials together.  If, however, you feel that we can edit the exercises via email that's fine too. Just let me know which arrangement makes you the most sense to you. Hope all is well.
