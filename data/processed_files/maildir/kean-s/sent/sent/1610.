	James D Steffes 		  While we don't need to do any lobbying on this bill, if anyone hears any  information about chances for success it would be good to get the info to  me.  Enron Wind has an interest in seeing this bill move forward. Thanks, Jim 		  Despite the fact the bill, by itself, does not guarantee payment for overdue  receivables, the QFs on today's call decided to go forward and push for SBX  47 irrespective of the progress on SBX 33.  A press conference is planned for  Friday by IEP.  Bowen, who heads up the first committee that this bill will  go through will have hearings on this bill on Tuesday at the earliest. Jan S-J asked every QF to fax to IEP a description of all QF generation and  the zip code of each project so that they can begin lobbying specific  legislators.  A significant PR push is planned. SBX 47 is opposed by SCE.  PG&E's position appears more ambivalent.  One  angle would be to try to get PG&E to support Enron's swap/SC language and  make inclusion of such language a condition of PG&E's support. GAC
