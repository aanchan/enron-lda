I'm afraide this leaves too much room to manuever.  Having duties related to  setting legislative affairs strategy and developing a plan for contacts on  the Hill, will give Cynthia the idea that she can run all aspects of those  duties, not just those related specifically to her substantive area.  I think  it is also worth covering the heavy emphasis on teamwork and supporting,  rather than directing, others in the organization. Richard Shapiro Good to go.
