This is very good work.  You make all the points we need to make without  spraining anything in the process.  You have been doing a superb job under  very difficult circumstances. On another note:  I don't know if you received my page, but the meeting with  Davis was cancelled so I flew back to Houston.  We are trying to get another  time, perhaps as early as this week.  Davis did meet with Greenspan and  Summers, both of whom we had briefed extensively. 	Jeff Dasovich 27th/28th You're right, Sue.  Rates can't go up w/out declaring the rate freeze over in  some fashion---trying to finesse it.  Thanks very much for the comments.   Harry also had a good comment---don't specify the amount of rate increase in  our comments; rather note that the rate increase needs to be well-reasoned  and based on facts and evidence.  Will make that change. 	Susan J Mara 		 27th/28th Jeff, This looks good.  It comes across as moderate in tone-- although probably no  one else will ask to leave the rate freeze in place.  I have a legal question -- Under AB 1890, I don't see anyway that the CPUC  can raise rates without ending the rate freeze first.  Am I missing  something? So, how is it clear that the CCPUC can raise the rates on Feb 1?   It's clear,however,  that once the retained assets are valued that the rates  can be changed. 	Jeff Dasovich 	 Attached is a draft of the talking points for the Commission's hearings.  Few  points: Our time is likely to be limited to 5-10 minutes. Mike Day, our outside counsel, will make the presentation on our behalf. Mike Day is fleshing out the legal details of our presentation and he will  forward that along for folks review later today.
