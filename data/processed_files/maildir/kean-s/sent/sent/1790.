Let's make sure that he gets our list of FERC Commissioner candidates (with  special emphasis on Wood and Brownell). 	Richard Shapiro 		  FYI Barbara A Hueter Barbara A Hueter Rick, We just heard the news that Spencer Abraham is being named Secretary of  Energy.  Jim Crawford, our lobbyist in Michigan, has an excellent  relationship with Spencer Abraham.  They are very good friends from their  college days and through the  years.  They have also worked together on  numerous political campaigns. Last October at Governor Engler's request, Ken Lay wrote a personal check for  $25,000 and we issued a corporate check for $25,0000 to the chamber of  commerce to support Spencer.  This is not to mention any other support he may  have recieved from our PAC. Jim has always been willing in the past to faciliate meetings with Senator  Abraham and will still be willing to do so with Secretary Abraham.  I am sure  our DC office has a relationship with him, but feel free to contact Jim  Crawford should you need any assistance.  He can be reached at 517-482-5000.   Janine.  Barbara.
