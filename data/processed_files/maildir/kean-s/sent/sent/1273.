Is Jeff available? Richard Shapiro We should do it.,....and should check Ken or Jeff's availability. Steve and Rick: I just received a call from NARUC's meeting coordinator, and she is putting  together a panel of speakers to address "what is needed to achieve a balanced  energy policy" at the summer committee meeting.   The panel will consist of 2  state commissioners, a consumer "type", an environmental advocate, and an  energy CEO.  She is interested in having someone from Enron on the panel,  which is scheduled for July 16th in Seattle.  Are we interested in doing this?   Lisa
