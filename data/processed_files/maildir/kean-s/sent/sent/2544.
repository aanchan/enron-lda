Will you be filling out mine? Sorry! 	Elizabeth Linnell 		  Here comes the project we've all been waiting for!  Attached below is the  headcount worksheet for the 2002 budget.  This data will be used to determine  benefits amounts/percentages and insurance coverage.  Note that there are  four pages in the workbook to be filled out.   Please return the spreadsheets to me by June 21st.  If you need any help or  have any questions, I'm available at 713-853-3896. Thanks!
