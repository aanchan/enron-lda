Offer him the job. FYI--go to the Internet Strategy one for what you need. I am pretty sure he will work out with me and Jeff--you can pull the trigger  and hire him with my concurrence if you feel comfortable enough. - Rob Rob, I think the meeting with Steve went great.  He asked me to forward you some  presentations that I have made, and that you would pass them on to him.  They  are here in reverse chrono order.  Pass my regards and enjoy your vacation. Cheers Hamd
