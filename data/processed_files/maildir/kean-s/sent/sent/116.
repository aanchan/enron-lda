Please revise the document as Aleck's changes indicate.  With respect to the  alternative responses shown near the end of the document, leave both  alternatives in. Richard Shapiro I am comfortable w/ the changes. On question of whether we colluded W/   Powerex, I would opt for simpler alternative and say we complied w/ all rules  of the pool. Thanks. Privileged and Confidential - For Instruction of  Counsel                                                 Attached is a revised  copy of the Background note discussed earlier this week.  The revisions are  based on comments  from Frontier Economics and GPC, and further reflection by  Rob Hemstock and myself. I have also attached the  raw calculations from  Frontier that underlie several of the revisions.  I have not  sent the  revised document to outside counsel for review.
