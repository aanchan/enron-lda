		  Apparently I spoke too soon.  Fourteen ideas were deposited into the  ThinkBank today -- including entries from Frankfurt, Toronto, London and  Pleasanton, California.  All levels of employees have participated from  assistant to senior director. 	Sarah Palmer 		  Well, it seems that eThink has another hit.  Twelve people have already put  well-conceived business ideas into the ThinkBank and we have received  numerous congratulatory calls.  I won't have site hits until next week, but  the active participation has been the highest of all our current applications  on their respective launch day. Have a great weekend, Sarah.
