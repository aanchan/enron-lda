My only comment relates to the Azurix reference  ... it's not a significant  part of the biz and things have changed recently.  i don't think it merits  reference. 		  Steve- can you have someone take a look at the attached article and give me  your thoughts. There is a lot of information in there that I did not provide  but they must be picking up from literature. Thanks, Rick Hi Rick, As we discussed this morning. Regards, James James Lam Hi Rick, Thank you again for spending time with Alan and me this week on the Enron case study for my book.  Attached for your review is a draft that we put  together.  I think you will be happy with the tone and content of the case.  Otherwise, please call me to discuss any changes you might have. (See attached file: 17_Enron-am-jl.doc) Note that the case makes reference to three charts that you said you would  email to me:    Organizational chart of the RAC Group and summary descriptions (we will use    this information to update this section of the case)    Dashboard approval sheet (cartoon version)    1-page flow chart of Board transaction approval process Please provide these three charts and any changes you might have by Friday, 9/15.  Thanks. Regards, James 212-541-8100  - 17_Enron-am-jl.doc
