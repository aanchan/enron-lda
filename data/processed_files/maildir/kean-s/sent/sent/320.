attached is Sen. Hagel's energy speech.  He focusses on oil primarily but  also does a nice job of framing the importance of sound energy policy to our  continued economic growth. 	Rosalee Fleming 		  Ken wanted to make sure you saw this speech. Joe Hillings Rosalee: I understand that Ken Lay and Senator Hagel will be together this  evening at the Horatio Alger event I believe in Williamsburg. The attachment  is the speech Chuck gave this week before ESI and Ken may find it helpful in  some discussion tonight. Joe      I thought you might be interested in seeing a copy of a speech on      international energy policy that Sen.
