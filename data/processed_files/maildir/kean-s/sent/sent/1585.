		  FYI:   com]  Michael, I received today the attached letter from Jonathon Rosenthal of Saybrook Capital. Based on the conversation you and I had yesterday, I think that a proper counter proposal would be to meet in LA, organize a credit committee, and instruct Saybrook to seek funding from PG&E and SCE.  But, I would be interested in hearing your thoughts. gba  - WPTF jmw_.doc
