Neither Ken nor Jeff are available.  It would probably be better for one of  you to speak anyway.  Any interest? Steve, Here's the invitation I mentioned.? Thanks for following up on this and my  own personal invitation to get somebody to come to class. Pankaj Dear Pankaj,  I enjoyed meeting you last week in BA.? Steve Reifenberg and I are both  grateful for your willingness to speak to Ken Lay at Enron on our behalf.?? I  have attached a copy of the letter we sent to him, as well as the preliminary  program for the October 20 DRCLAS Corporate Partners Program.? When we called  to follow up, we were told that it was unlikely that Ken Lay would be able to  participate, so we extended the invitation to Jeff Skilling as well.? We  would be delighted to have either one speak on the case of Enron at the  event.  Thanks again, and please let me know if there is someone in Lay's office with  whom I should follow up after you speak with him.
