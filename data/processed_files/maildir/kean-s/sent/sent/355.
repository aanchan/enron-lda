Please pst and circulate to the team.  We probably need to open a new section  on the site to adress gas prices.

Attached is a  proposed set of talking points for use in Q&A and  briefing materials.    Please let me know if you find these message points to  be consistent with our general Enron response to pricing inquiries.
