the price might be a bit stiff, particularly in light of the following: I  don't think we need the DC grass tops component.  we have an effective set of  messages, contacts, consultants and lawyers.  Perhaps we could use Charlie as  a fresh set of eyes on that stuff, but I think that asking him to develop  such an effort would be duplicative of what we have done with AAE, Paxson,  Fleischman-Hillard, Divall, etc. I do think the other aspects of what he proposes would be useful, however,  (and should be less resource intensive and at least a little less costly). What do you think? Dear Mr. Shapiro: Attached is a memo from Charlie Baker regarding the FERC that he asked that I forward to you. If you have any questions, please call him at (617) 428-3412 or me at (617) 367-9929. Thank you. Sincerely, Kelly Goss Dewey Square Group  - dsg e-mail to shapiro at enron 800.doc
