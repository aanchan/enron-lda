fyi 		  Mickey Townsell Kalen, I spoke with TJ today and he indicated that he is interested in talking with  Enron ; however , he and his spouse were taking off for a five week break  between jobs ( he said he had told Ken of his plans ). That he would like to  set something up in late March upon his return. I will call him and set  up a  date with him. We have a good lead time to get on the G9 calendars. I will keep you updated. MT Kalen Pieper Steve, Mickey Townsell has contacted TJ Glauthier, the former Deputy Secretary, and  is beginning exploratory interviews.  We will keep you posted on progess.
