any interest? 	Eric Thode 		  Is this of interest to you? Eric     	 	 	 Imad Tareen forwarded me his resume for a possible job opportunity in our  group.  (Please see below.)  I have never met him before, and I have no idea  how he got my phone number, but his resume looks quite good.  What do you  think? Yvette Imad Tareen Hi  Yvette Thanks for your help.  I  am very interested in exploring opportunities in  your group.  I have a Masters in Public Policy from Harvard which deals a lot  with communications and running  campaigns. Imad
