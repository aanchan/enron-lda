I won't be going.  Let's look for an alternate.  I'd be happy to come to DC. Mack McLarty and his people would like to get together with you in Los  Angeles during the Dem convention to discuss our Southern Cone issues,  strategies, etc.  Will you be there on the Monday? Steve Steve: Speaking of LA, I have spoken to Mack's scheduler, Andrea, and it appears into the Enron schedule.  It probably makes the most sense to have her coordinate any such meeting.  How would you recommend that we proceed? Thanks, Kellie
