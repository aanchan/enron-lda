Vince J Kaminski Toni, I would like to bring two people for an interview  One of them sent me a message that is attached below. I am including the info about the 2nd gentleman below. I would like to include myself, Vasant Shnabhogue, Tanya Tamarchenko Stinson Gibner, Zimin Lu, Paulo Issler,  Alex Tang on the interview list. It would be great if we could bring them this week on Friday. Tanya will be at a training course next week. This means that if Friday this week  is too aggressive, we should shoot for interviews in 2 weeks. Sorry for a short notice.
