Ravi, Maybe Stinson can get on this conference call. I shall be at the office on  Thursday  only this week. Vince Hi Vince, Mark Holsworth reviewed our contract on such a short notice.  I  thank Mark for responding to our short-notice request.  It turns out that we  need to get this database to move forward on a number of things and have  legal save some time for us is an excellent help.  As mentioned below, It  appears that PennWell's folks want to chat some more about this.  Mark, can you schedule a conference call with these people to finalise this  contract.  I will be out of town all week next week on a lock-down deal  meeting. Vince may be able to get on the conference call.  I would greatly  appreciate it if you could help us close this one!
