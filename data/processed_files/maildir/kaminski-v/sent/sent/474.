Shirley,  Please, put it on my calendar. Vince Vince, I am delighted that you accept our invitation.  We hope it works out that you  can attend the whole conference as we are confident that you will find the  program stimulating and will enjoy getting to know our participants.  The  pleasure will certainly be mutual.  You will bring a new and different  perspective from which we can all benefit. Michael Paul,  Thank you for the invitation to speak at the Eastern Conferences on   Regulation and Competition on May the 25th. I shall be glad to attend and   make an after dinner presentation. I hope to be able to attend the entire   conference.  Sorry for a delay in responding to your message. I have been traveling   extensively in the last few weeks.  Vince Return-path:   Full-name: VKaminski  Message-ID:   Vince:  For two decades now, I have been a member of the faculty helping to  organize the Eastern Conferences on Regulation and Competition that Michael  Crew of Rutgers has chaired.  This year will be, in fact, the 20th  anniversary conference and a number of notable personages will be joining  us to celebrate what we have learned and what we haven't about the  economics of network industries.  Fred Kahn, Al Philipps, Bill Hogan and a  number of other distinguished academics will be reviewing our progress and  the prospects for the future.  The conference will take place at a  beautiful site in the Poconos, about 90 minutes north of Philadelphia, from  Wednesday afternoon May 24th to Friday afternoon May 26th.  You can check  for yourself the nature of the program and the conference site/hotel at the  following website URL:  http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~crri/WS.htm  Michael Crew and I would both be delighted if you would be willing to be an  after dinner speaker on Thursday evening (May 25th), just before the key  research reviews of Friday morning take place on the electricity, telephone  and gas industries, and following a day of special topics on emerging power  markets and other developments in network industries.   Naturally we would  be pleased if you would be able to stay for the entire conference, but  knowing your schedule, you may only have time for a part of it.  That would  not be a problem.  The usual after-dinner address is for 30 minutes,  followed by a short Q&A period.  Your presentation would help to underline the tremendous importance of  Enron in driving the development of new risk instruments to assist in price  discovery and efficient risk management for market participants, in energy  markets and more generally.  Both Michael and I feel that your perspectives  on the "new science of risk management" and what can be expected from it  could be a very important addition to this special anniversay event.  Please let me know (and please do copy Michael on your response) whether  your schedule will allow your participation in this very special event.  Michael and I would, of course, be very happy to follow up with you in  discussing the nature of the presentation, participants and so forth, if  this is a go.  I look forward to hearing from you.
