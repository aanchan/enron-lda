Joe, This is the most recent offer from Lacima (weather derivatives course). What do you think? Vince Vince, Enron is fine (although I think we have to pay for the Hyatt anyway). ? Good discount (I have a feeling that my idea of a good discount and the   weather desk's idea is probably different?):? for the one day, $1100 per   person.? If you think that there will be?around 10 people or more,  then we  can offer a day rate, regardless of the number of people.?  ? Thanks Vince ? Julie ? PS - Of course when I announced that we were cancelling, people started   responding that they wished to attend.? Ugh! ? cc: Vince, Great. Just to let you know,  we decided not to wait on the indecisive ones, and postponed the open  course. It's yours, whatever you want: ? 1 day (specific to what you  feel will be of the most benefit), 2 days, Hyatt or? Enron, or not at  all. I hope this doesn't cause problems for you. Special deal, for sure. I  owe my godfather. Julie cc: Vince, We just wanted to let you  know? that we only have 3 people signed up for the weather  derivatives course? (all from Enron) so far. We have a couple  more that have expressed strong? interest, but we are awaiting their  final decision. If no one else signs? up, Chris and Les thought that  you guys could probably get through the? first day pretty easily, and  thus thought it may be an option to teach just? the 2nd day  material (pricing) only at Enron (doing it at the Hyatt is an?  option as well but the room might be on the large side)? We would?  obviously reimburse you for the day not taught. We can teach both days  as? well, but thought you may want to save some time. I just  wanted to give? you some time to think about it. We will know where we  stand on final? numbers by next?  Wednesday. Julie
