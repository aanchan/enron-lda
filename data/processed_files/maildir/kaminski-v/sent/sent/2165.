    	 	 	 Vince--shades of Cuiba You spoke to me once and I gave you my opinions which were contrary to your  resultant offer to Cairn. Currently, I have better things to do with my time.  I talked to Vince after we hung up and his only suggestion was to call  Sandeep Kohli.  I spoke with Marc and yourself four times on this matter over  a 3 day period and given the timing, I put forth a non-binding offer, after  discussing it further with Bobby, based on the information I had that appears  to position us close to our competitors offers.  We haven't committed  ourselves and should we be selected for negotiations there are numerous  variables to affect the outcome.  If you've got any suggestions for a better  deal, please advise. I strongly disagree with the pricing and structure of your non-binding offer  to Cairn. This reminds me of the debacle in Brazil. You should have contacted  Vince Kaminski's research group as we talked about before an offer was made.  This is a bad deal.  Doug & Marc, FYI, please let me know if you think we're totally off base.  I appreciate  your help. Regards, Doug Douglas S Parsons Bobby, After meeting with Cairn today in Delhi, my perception is that our offer was  received well.  They were more open and relaxed then they were on Wed.  morning and made several encouraging comments about our price range, (once we  talked through the price movements), and the seriousness of our gas related  activities on the West Coast of India, in light of the IOC agreement.  I  think the overall package is attractive to them and no serious objections  were raised.  We did talk to some extent about the guarantees, but we didn't  get too far and they're willing to accept at this point that what's  acceptable to the LNG suppliers, should be suitable for their needs.   However, they would like to understand the corporate structure and assets of  Enron Energy Marketing a little better and I told them I would get back to  them on that point. David and Ajay were up in Hazira yesterday looking at some property for their  gas treatment facility, which apparently is across the road from pipeline  access.  While there they went and looked at Shell's proposed LNG site after  walking the last 1 km, inaccessible to their 4wd vehicle and not surprisingly  found a beach. In summary, here is what we offered on a non-binding basis: Six year production plateau 85% TOP $3.67/MMBtu Net, at a base of $18/bbl Brent, with point of sale at the  tail-end of the gas processing plant Floor & Cap of $15.50 - $27.00/bbl Price movement:  +/- $1.00/ bbl from the $18/bbl base price (on a 3 mo.  rolling average) equals +/- $0.145/MMBtu fixed on a quarterly basis Guarantees:  Same protection we're providing the LNG suppliers under the  Trust Retention Account I appreciate everyone's help in submitting this offer. Thanks, Doug
