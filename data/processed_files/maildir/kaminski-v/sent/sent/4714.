Shirley, OK. Vince Hi Shirley, I would like to request for a new PC.  My current PC is quite old with not  enough memory.  Twice  I ran out of memory and had to have IT people coming to clean it for me.  Their suggestion is to either get a new hard drive or a new PC.  Given that Dell has Pentiumc III  Processor at 800 MHz on market, I would like to request a PC with process at 500 MHz or higher  level.  Thank you very much. Best, Alex
