Elizabeth, FYI Vince Dear Dr. Kaminski: I enjoyed our discussion this morning. It sounds like there is a great deal of overlap between Enron business units and my interests. I am very much looking forward to meeting you and your colleagues. Thank-you for the invitation to interview with your group. Sincerely, Rodney Greene
