Jeff, FYI. We completed the review of the LNG model. The copy of the review is available if you want to take a look at it. Vince The review of Eric Groves' LNG Model spreadsheet has been completed.  No  independent model was available for use in the comparison; however, the model  appears complete and accurate in representating all important cost and  revenue elements. If this financial model is coupled with a optimization model for planning  ship usage in the future, additional variables may be needed to represent the  variability of trip times, weather factors, etc.  A reference describing  these possible additions was provided.
