Zimin, Stinson I think I forwarded the message to you. Did we act on it? Vince Vince, Rob and I would like to coordinate a meeting with one of your Research people  to review the Spread Option calculation from the Exotica options library.   We're pricing a spread option deal in NYC and have some questions related to  the formula, greeks, etc.  Please let me know who might be available to sit  with us for about 1/2 hour.  Thanks - Jim     	 	 	 Attached are the Delta positions for the NYC Constellation deal.  If you have  any questions or would like to review the model, please call me. Thanks, Mason
