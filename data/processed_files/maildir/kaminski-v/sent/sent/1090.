Tanya Tamarchenko simulations   Vince, sorry, the files from that directory get deleted periodically. I  attached this file here. Rabi did some analysis related to implementation of correlated non-normally  (RTDM-distributed) variables. Let's discuss later? Tanya. Vince J Kaminski simulations   Tanya, I could not locate the file. Vince Tanya Tamarchenko simulations   Everybody,  we were talking for a while about using non-normal distributions in the  Monte-Carlo simulations in our VAR model. I put together some suggestion regarding this. The text is under  O:\_Dropbox\Tanya\non_normal_logs.doc Look through this 3 page document, and let me know what you think, please. Tanya
