FYI Vince Vince, I will attend this meeting.  I'm looking forward to finding out a little more  about the London Economics model. Tom Tom, Can you attend this meeting? You have reviewed this memo before. Vince Vince, as I mentioned, attached  please find an overview memo on the PoolMod  model. We would like to invite your group to attend a meeting with the people  from London Economics (tentatively Thursday noon) to discuss the benefits of  using this model to predict pool prices in Colombia Thanks, Maria Elena  - Briefing Memo - Overview of SDDP and PoolMod.doc Eric Shumway Consultant London Economics, Inc.
