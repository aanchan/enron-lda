Paulo Issler Vince/Stinson: I just came back from a meeting with Accounting (Ryan Siueck) and Credit (Rod  Nelson - works with Bill Bradford) in which we presented the two-factor model  for calculating credit loss on our LJM's position. Rod seemed positive with  the model conceptual approach. He will position Bill Bradford on that.  Accounting will have a meeting with AA to discuss the treatment on credit  necessary.  At year-end the difference on both valuations - without and with credit risk  - indicates a credit loss of about 100 MM.  Paulo Issler
