Karen, Yes, but I think it's confidential. Please, contact David Port about the release possibility. Vince Vince, Can you tell me whether Enron has a formal written Risk Management Policy? Thanks, Karen Marshall 		  		  Hello, I am enrolled in a Maritime Management Masters program at Maine Maritime Academy in Castine, Maine and am currently studying "Global Risk Management and Insurance" as one of my courses. As part of my research for a term paper I am investigating organizations in the oil business to see whether or not they have formalized a {Risk Management Policy Statement}. Does Enron have such a policy statement and if so would I be able to acquire and incorporate it into my research paper. If available, I would appreciate some info on how Enron is involved in Risk Management. Brgds, Jim Parsons, MM., BMS.
