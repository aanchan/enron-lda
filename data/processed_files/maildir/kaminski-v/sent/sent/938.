Vince, Berney asked me to send you a copy of our spread option models.  The  first is a more detailed spread option model created by Jim Simpson  (currently in the Chicago office), the second is a simplified version of  Simpson's model that I put together for less complicated tolling structures.   Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss. - Jim
