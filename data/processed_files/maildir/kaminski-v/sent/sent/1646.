Zimin Lu Sanjeev and John, Thanks for your continuing interest for the storage model.   The storage  model is the extension to the swing model we sent you earlier, in the case of swing,  you are only allowed to withdraw or hold.   I will add some heading to the "log" files from the  model.  These files includes Curve.txt  which records the price trajectories of the  first 10 simulations, Op???.txt, where ??? are the numbers represent the day,  these files record decisions for each gas level, each price node for the given day. All these files are C:\temp. I did a presentation about the storage valuation, which explains the basic  ideas.   Take a look, I am open for more discussions. Zimin
