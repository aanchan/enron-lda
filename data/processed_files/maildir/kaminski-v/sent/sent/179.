Hi again,  As, I stated is a prior emails, the contact details for the RiskCalc folks  are as follows: 1.  Marc Brammer Director of Strategic Sales tel:  800.523.2627, x5706 2. Neal Clark Vice President Tel:  800.523.2627, x5701  Neal said that he would be willing to set up a meeting between us and their  quants to better understand their model, the various inputs and whether or  not the model can be tweaked for less than the 17 specified inputs.  Let me know if you guys wish to have Neal set up a conference between  Moody's quants and Enron folks in Houston and London. Ciao, Iris Hi,  Two RiskCalc sales people made a presentation this week about their product.  They stated that they could set up a meeting with their quants and our  people to discuss the model input and what happens if we have less than 17  inputs.   Regards, Iris Hi Mike,  Thanks for your email.  What do you mean by "buying blind  all major data associated with these  specific DUNS numbers"?  I am puzzled about why you would be looking at 17 vs 12 fields.  I know  RiskCalc requires 17 inputs and seem to apply that the model does not work  for less than 17.  Yesterday the RiskCalc sales people could not guarantte  that their model would work for less than the required 17 data inputs.  They  suggested that this would be a question to direct towards their quants who  developed the model. Regards, Iris Cc: Dhar, Amitava; Salmon, Scott; Kirkpatrick, Eric Iris, Thanks. After our meeting we stuck around to discuss things a little further. Specifically with respect to global counterparty names... we have DUNS  cross-references on about 70 of active names (13k out of 18.5k).  We could  greatly accellerate purchase of some useful data by buying blind all major  data associated with these specific DUNS numbers. Pro  -  Data gets in on names we know we want to review ASAP, but without  resolution on which specific fields are most useful.  We also get to test for  completeness of data (how many have all 17 fields... how many have only 12 of  which fields, etc.). Con  -  Costs could be significantly higher... buying info we don't know we  need (converse of buying only the 17 fields doesn't seem best answer).  We  would end up buying additional info later... overhead costs and piecemeal  buying will increase costs.  IT development time would be greatly  increased... multiple file formats... developing to unknown maximum size,  etc.... redoing when more data is purchased. Any thoughts. Mike
