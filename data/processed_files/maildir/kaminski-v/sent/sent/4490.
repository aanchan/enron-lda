Margaret, I have an economist in my group and asked her if she feels qualified to make a presentation on this topic. I shall keep you posted. I think It would help Enron to oblige. Vince Vince,   I  could  work up a talk on everything  they are looking  for   except  the area  of   energy impacts  on agri-customers...does  ENA  have   some specialist  that look at this slice of  the energy marke  that   could  help me  respondt?  Thanks  Margaret    Beth Jensen Hello Margaret.  We are looking for a speaker for a meeting that is being  arranged with Nebraska Governor Johanns during the first week in April. The potential topic is a national perspective on pricing pressures/trends on  natural gas, electricity and oil and their impact on agricultural production  costs, as well as types of risk managment tools that are being used to offset  the price fluctuations. Do you know of anyone, either within the Corporation or outside, who would be  available to travel to Omaha to make this presentation?   I would appreciate any assistance that you could provide, Margaret. Thanks,  beth jensen
