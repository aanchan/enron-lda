Shirley Crenshaw There is a projector in that conference room already. Thanks! Shirley Shirley- Vince asked me to arrange a mtg Wednesday between himself, Vasant and I (for  30 minutes+). Can you coordinate this? (I already emailed Vasant and told him  about it). I would like an overhead projector for it, if possible. Thanks, Clayton
