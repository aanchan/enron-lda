Debbie, This is an update on the continuing Winston saga. Tanya identified the sections of the code that produce inefficiencies but the rest is in the Winston's hands. Steve Stock is very cooperative and takes a very rational, Enron-first approach to the problem. Privately, my concern is that the code, based on  Tanya's report to me, leaves a lot to be desired. The code tends to be a very  mechanical implementation of the algorithm, developed without a series attempt to  optimize it. Let's keep paddling along. Vince 	 Vince, ...just to keep you in the loop on the Tanya / Winston issue... regards Steve Tanya, how's it going with code-review from your perspective? ...did you manage to talk to our Documentation contractors? ...if not, would you me to arrange for them to bring you the documentation as  it currently stands? regards Steve
