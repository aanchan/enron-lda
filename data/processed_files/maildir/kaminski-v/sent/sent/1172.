Shirley Crenshaw Kate asked me to forward this to you - thought you would enjoy it.   However, I must tell you that as a group we beat all the odds.  We have three sets of people that have the same birthday - of course not the same year - just the same day! Amitava and Jaesoo March 2 Shirley and Stephen July 20 Stinson and Gwyn September 23 Cheers! Shirley Kate Lucas Shirley, Would you please pass this on to the rest of the group? It refers to our  lunchtime conversation about birthdays falling on the same day for two people  in a group. Thanks, Kate
