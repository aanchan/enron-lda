Shirley, He will have to pay the rent. Vince Shirley Crenshaw Vince: Molly called me today and Bhala wants us to get him an apartment for the summer.  Will this be charged to our cost center or does he pay the rent on this? Please let me know as soon as possible. Thanks! Shirley Stinson Gibner Shirley, FYI -- Bhala is planning to start 5/28 --Stinson Stinson:   Just a friendly reminder about the job description for Bhala.  He  called us today, and is becoming somewhat apprehensive about time.   He said  that you need only provide 3-4 lines of a job description, and that it's not  necessary to go into any real depth.   Bhala also wanted to confirm a start  date of 5/28/01 so that he can give notice at his apartment. Thanks, Molly  x34804
