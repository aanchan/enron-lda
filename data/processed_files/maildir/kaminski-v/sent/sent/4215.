Shirley Crenshaw Hi Amy: That is fine, Vince was going to come on the 28th anyway, but he will probably need to come earlier - please let me know what time you have scheduled the dinner so I can make his airline reservations.   Thanks! Shirley Hi Shirley, I just realized that I goofed on the dinner - it will be held on Sunday, May 28th instead of the 29th.  Sorry about that! I hope your day is going well so far. Amy Good morning Amy: Vince Kaminski will need the following:    An LCD Projector to hook up to a lap tap for his presentation    He will have dinner with the conference organizers and speakers on the 29th.    He will need 2 nights (the 28th and the 29th) hotel reservations. He will send you an abstract shortly. Thanks and have a great day!
