Carl, Depends if it is more like financial or insurance type hedging. I shall leave it to Vasant to decide. Vince Vince, thank you for the response.  In the interim, we met with Vasant  Shanbhogue yesterday and explained the deal and what we needed.  Should  Vasant continue to work on it, or would you still like us to loop in Zimin  Lu?   Zimin, Carl Tricoli  (5-8958) will call you regarding help on ethanol (hedging). Vince
