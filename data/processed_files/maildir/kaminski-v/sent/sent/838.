Ken A tour would be great (after 10:30, if they can make it). Please, let Shirley know about the meeting. Vince Vince, 19C is available and reserved for 9 am to 10:30, Wednesday.   Would you like me to try and arrange a tour for the students or should we  wait until we know more about their interests?   Are their some other Enron folks you would like to invite for Wednesday? ken
