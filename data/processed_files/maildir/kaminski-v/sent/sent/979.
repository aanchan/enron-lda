Molly, Yes, March 1 would work. Vince     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Just checking to be sure you're okay with a March 1 start date for Iris? Molly     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 Hi,      Thanks for the Fed Ex with the offer letter, and other pertinent information about Enron.      I have signed the letter and returned it to you, along with a couple of other forms.  You should receive these documents via Fed Ex on tomorrow morning.      Because I have to tie up a few loose ends here in California, I won't be able to start until March 1st.  I hope that is okay.      Thanks so much. Regards, Iris Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com
