Dear Vince:         I am in some preliminary dialogues with some faculty in the math department about the possibility of establishing a special program perhaps at master's level on financial engineering.  The attach pdf file is my own sketch about the program. Since you have extensive knowledge about these things, can you give me some comments.        Ed  - FIN_ENGR.PDF
