Rick, I shall ask my assistant  to schedule a meeting early next week. Vince Richard B Jones Vince,  While I was at HSB, I designed an insurance or reinsurance financial model  that HSB uses for new product development, pricing different reinsurance  strategies, computing stochastic earnings forecast, and estimating  probabilistic maintenance & repair costs. The code, written in Visual Basic &  MS Access belongs to HSB, and I want to replicate it here for our use at  Enron. I would like to arrange a time to specifically talk to you and perhaps  Vasant who was briefed on the model, about how we can use your group for the  analytical and programming support to get this model re-constructed.  I have screen outputs from the code and Vasant thought the re-design and  construction here at Enron is a problem that your group can do. Could you let  me know when we can setup an hour to discuss? Thanks, Rick Jones
