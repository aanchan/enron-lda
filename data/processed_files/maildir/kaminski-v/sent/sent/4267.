Zimin Lu Martina Angelova Hi Zimin! Please find attached the RPI model I developed by bootstrapping RPI swaps.  The structure of this particular swap is:   semi/semi Act/365F  YOYUKRPI = (UKRPI(p-2)/UKRPI(p-14) - 1)/2  p = payment month The first payment is the latest known historical RPI, February 2000. You will  notice that I have assumed constant cashflows between the quoted years (as  opposed to interpolating swaps which distorts the curve a lot). Please find below a graphic comparison between the RPI curve produced by  swaps and the one produced by the GILT market. Looking forward to your comments. Best regards, Martina x34327
