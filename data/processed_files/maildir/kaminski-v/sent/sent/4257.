Always identify people in your yard before shooting squirrels.   3. It's considered tacky to take a cooler to church.   4. If you have to vacuum the bed, it is time to change the sheets.   5. Even if you're certain that you are included in the will, it is   still considered improper to drive a U-Haul to the funeral home.     DINING OUT   1. When decanting wine, make sure that you tilt the paper cup, and pour   slowly so as not to "bruise" the fruit of the vine.   2. If drinking directly from the bottle, always hold it with your   fingers covering the label.     ENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME   1. A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared by a   taxidermist.   2. Do not allow the dog to eat at the table...no matter how good his   manners are.     PERSONAL HYGIENE   1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that should   be done in private using one's OWN truck keys.   2. Proper use of toiletries can forestall bathing for several days.   However, if you live alone, deodorant is not a waste of good money.   3. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they   tend to detract from a woman's jewelry and alter the taste of finger   foods.     DATING (Outside the Family)   1. Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the first date.   2. Be aggressive. Let her know you're interested:  "I've been wanting   to go out with you since I read that stuff on the bathroom wall two  years   ago."   3. Establish with her parents what time she is expected back. Some will   is the man's responsibility to get her to school on time.     THEATER ETIQUETTE   1. Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked up immediately   after the movie has ended.   2. Refrain from talking to characters on the screen. Tests have proven   they can't hear you.     WEDDINGS   1. Livestock, usually, is a poor choice for a wedding gift.   2. Kissing the bride for more than 5 seconds may get you shot.   3. For the groom, at least, rent a tux. A leisure suit with a   cummerbund and a clean bowling shirt can create an unappealing  appearance.   4. Though uncomfortable, say "yes" to socks and shoes for this special   occasion.     DRIVING ETIQUETTE   1. Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles; Even if the gun is   loaded, and the deer is in sight.   2. When approaching a four-way stop, the vehicle with the largest tires   always has the right of way.   3. Never tow another car using panty hose and duct tape.   4. When sending your wife down the road with a gas can, it is impolite   to ask her to bring back beer.   5. Do not lay rubber while traveling in a funeral procession.   6. Do not mend mufflers with bubble-gum if your truck back-fires
