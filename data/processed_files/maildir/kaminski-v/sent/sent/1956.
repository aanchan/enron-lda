Shirley Another trip to schedule at some point. Vince Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit  MSCF Speaker Series -November 3rd confirmation X-Priority: 3 X-MSMail-Priority: Normal X-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V5.00.2314.1300 Dear Mr. Kaminski,  It is a great pleasure and a great honor to schedule you on the MSCF Speaker Series list for November 3rd, I will make reservation for 8 persons at a restaurant in Pittsburgh for that evening. Also, if you want I can book an hotel for you. Let me know if you have anything in mind  for the topic of the presentation. There is no real guidelines as we like our speakers to have as much room as possible. Here is one of the past presentations that had an impact. One of our speakers divided the presentation in two, the first part was technical, the second was more general, explaining what his firm was looking for when hiring new employees. Thank you very much for accepting our invitation. Sincerely, Pierre-Philippe Ste-Marie pstemarie.homestead.com
