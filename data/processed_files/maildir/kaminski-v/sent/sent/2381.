Stinson, No problem. Vince Stinson Gibner Vince, Can I loan to Giuseppe my cell phone for the summer? Stinson I will be on the call. I may disconnect around 4:00 to attend the traders'  daily meeting.  A couple of issues: 1. Would it be possible to get Gappy a cell phone for the summer? He does not  have a phone at home. I think the reason for avoiding installing a phone in  his apartment is the increasing cost of his Houston stay. 2. It is getting noisier here. Gappy and I are wandering if we could get  office space downstairs (that we share). We will maintain presence on 44, but  we will be able to discuss when needed. -Samer
