Ian, Sorry for a delay in responding to you. I am currently in London, flying back to Houston tomorrow. The problem is not  with the lawyers. We worked on our presentation materials together with a professor from another university and we agreed to use these materials only internally. We have to honor our commitment to him. I am sure that this is exactly what you would have expected from us if we had made a similar commitment to you. Vince    What do I need to do to move this thing forward? I suspect that the problem is basically with the lawyers.  They only know how  to stop things, but in a way they play a role in global society.  If it were  not for the handicaps they lay on us the rest of the world would never have a  chance. cc: I still have not heard from your lawyer.  I would like to see whar materials you are using and assess how we could work on the topic of real options with Enron
