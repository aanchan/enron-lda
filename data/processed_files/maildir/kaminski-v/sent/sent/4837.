Greg, One of many data points I have the competition is paying more. Vince Stinson Gibner F.Y.I. Stinson, I have accepted an amended offer from Southern Company Energy Marketing.  My decision was based on the higher compensation, and the opportunity to rotate through structuring, trading and research.  I am very confident that I would have been very engaged and happy working in your group; I did not take the decision lightly. I'll be moving to Atlanta in March, but I will keep the email and URL given below.  I'd like to stay in touch, and I expect to see you at conferences.  Also, please pass my regards on to Vince and Mike. -- Craig Jimenez http://AwlBiz.com (512) 699-5794 cellular
