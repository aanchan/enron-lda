Doug, We were trying to get everybody together for today but with no luck.  Wednesday next week is the first feasible date.  Sorry for that. Vince I'm assuming that this meeting is tomorrow (wednesday the 30th) not next  wednesday.  Hello everyone: The next LNG "Book" meeting has been scheduled for Wednesday, September 6 at 2:00 pm in EB19C2. Thanks! Shirley Crenshaw 3-5290
