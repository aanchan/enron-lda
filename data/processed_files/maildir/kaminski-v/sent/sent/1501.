Rick, I asked Greg Whalley and he declined (he has a speaking engagement in London  a day before). I have sent an invitation to Louise Kitchen and she has not  replied yet. I  shall catch her at the management conference in San Antonio  and ask for a commitment. It would help if you could mention this to her as well. Vince Where do we stand on this?  Is someone else going to do it? In checking with Jeff's Assistant this morning, we hope to get clarity on the schedule later today or Monday (at the latest, hopefully!). To paraphrase Daneil Webster's famous quote, "How stands our Conference?" Best, Ehud ==============================================      Ehud I. Ronn      Professor of Finance and Jack S.
