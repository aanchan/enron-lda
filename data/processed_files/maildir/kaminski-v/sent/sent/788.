Shirley Crenshaw Vince: Ashley Baxter called and wanted to know if you would be interested in going to Cal Berkeley on Monday and giving an overall Enron presentation on Monday night to a group of about 700 students.  She said they could do it, but thought you might want to. Let me or her know. Thanks! Shirley
