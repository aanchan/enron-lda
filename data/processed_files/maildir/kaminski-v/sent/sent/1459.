Stinson Gibner John, Here is the spreadsheet Zimin built for estimaing P/L from trading WTI  forwards.     Let Zimin, Vince, or I know if you have questions or comments. --Stinson Zimin Lu Stinson, I add the total P/L due to contract rollover.  When the number of trades is  large and the spread is not too small, the model prints a lot of money, dominated by those trade earning the half of BO spread.  I also wrote an explaination about the model on the front page. I think we  are  ready to deliever the model V.1. Zimin
