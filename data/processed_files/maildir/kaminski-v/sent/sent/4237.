Jana  HEA Renewals & Crawfish Boil Teaser Dear HEA Member:  This week is the absolute last week you can renew and be included in the  annual  directory.  Just call the office (713/651-0551) and if you have no changes,  you  can renew with your credit card over the phone.  Also, our next event is April 11th at Woodrow's on Chimney Rock.  HEA is  proud  to announce that the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) is our corporate  sponsor of the 8th Annual Crawfish Boil.  NYMEX is celebrating their 10th  anniversary of natural gas futures trading, and will be awarding several door  prizes that evening.  This will be the last event at which to purchase one of  the remaining raffle tickets for the Harley Davidson Sportster which will be  awarded to some lucky winner at ENERGY EXTRAVAGANZA on May 6, 2000.  So renew your dues, and watch your fax and email for more details about April  11th!
