Mike, Please, draft a message to JS, DD and JL outlining the AGA benefits and costs. This will be their decision. Vince     	 	 	 Vince- - - This project is getting lost in the cracks Should we meet with Dave Delainy to get it off high center?? - - - Mike Please see the string of messages below.     	 	 	 I actually called Stan Horton's office yesterday to find out if they knew  anything about the AGA membership, and Cindy Stark who works with Stan  informed me that Stan cancelled our associate membership with AGA effective  January, 2000.  I called Jay Copan with AGA back and left him a voicemail  with the information.  I asked him to call me if he had any questions and I  have not heard back from him.  I'll considered it closed unless I hear back  from him.     	 	 	 this is a Joe Hillings issue. Carolyn Cooney I believe that Stan Horton's office handled the dues for AGA.     	 	 	 Jay Copan with American Gas Assn. called.  Julie Caboose suggested that he  talk with you about Enron's AGA dues.  (He spoke to Rick Shapiro who said  that he has no knowledge of the dues situation).  Please call at 202-824-7020.
