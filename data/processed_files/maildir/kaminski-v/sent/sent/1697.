Alison, Thanks a lot. Vince     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 I promise we will do everything we can.  Right now Kristin's assistant, Alyse  Herasimchuk,  has a call the Cornell career office to put him on the  schedule.  If that doesn't work, Kristin will ask for the interviewers to  stay longer to interview him.  Will let you know as soon as we do.  Thanks for everything you do for us. Alison Vince J Kaminski Alison, I appreciate it. I really need your help on this one. His father is very  helpful in my recruiting  efforts at Berkeley. Vince     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 CORRECTION - I was going too fast last night ( You said Cornell not Carneige  Mellon). Cornell interviews are Monday, October 30 & Tuesday, October 31.  We  are faxing Shmuel Oren's resume to Kristin and checking to see if  there is  any time on the closed schedule, or if the interviewers will stay longer to  include him.  I will let you know today if we can make it work. Sorry my first e-mail was incorrect. Vince J Kaminski Charlene, Please, help. This is a son of a professor at Berkeley who helps me a lot in  the recruiting process. His son goes to Cornell. Can we invite him (the son, not the professor) to a  Super Saturday? I really want to repay the debt to his father who is very instrumental in  my recruiting  efforts. Vince ?  - Yaron-RESUME3.doc
