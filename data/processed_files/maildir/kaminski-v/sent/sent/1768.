Vince,              Herewith is a write-up I gave at the Research Meeting yesterday  on the worst-case-loss efforts I have been working on for the Equities  portfolio.  It is based on Wilmott's CrashMetrics and delta-gamma portfolio  optimization.  The goal is to ascertain how much possible loss a portfolio  can have, based on historical data.  Comments are welcome. Regards Naveen
