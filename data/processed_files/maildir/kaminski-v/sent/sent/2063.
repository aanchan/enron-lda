Ashley, I agree with you. Two trips are the best solution, unless of course Shmuel  rearranges the speaker list and the 16th will work for the presentation as well.  Coordinating so many different events is never easy. Thanks for your patience. Vince                             	 	Enron Technology 	 	 Vince, Actually, the General Presentation that I have scheduled for the Faculty Club  (a dining/meeting room) on campus is set for 7:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. on Monday  the 16th.    I can attempt to change the presentation date again, however I  feel that it would be very unlikely that we are able to get another facility  that is near campus.  At this point it may be better to plan on making two  seperate trips so that we are able to handle both events.  Maybe we could  combine another presentation in during the same visit.  What do you think? Ashley Shmuel, Let's see if we can either rearrange the seminar speakers or change the date of our visit to the campus. Ashley Baxter, our coordinator  is very efficient and got a faculty room for a presentation on Monday morning on the 16th. Vince Dear Vince. I spoke too soon. Apparently the seminar slot on the 16 was already filled. I will see if I can switch the speaker for that week to the following week. In any case we are on for dinner on the 16. ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Shmuel S.

I sent you a reply earlier this month but I haven't heard from you about  the   date of your visit. Our department has a Seminar every Monday. If you can   schedule your visit on a Monday I would like to invite you to give a  seminar   which will be attended by many of our graduate students and faculty and  will   give you an opportunity to tell them about your program. With sufficient   lead-time I can advertise the seminar in the Hass school to their  financial   engineering students.   Shmuel.   /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////   Shmuel S.

I visited you together with Aram Sogomonian, a    good friend of mine, a few years ago. I am currently responsible, among    other things, for recruiting graduates with finance and/or technical    backgrounds at the University of Berkeley. I would be glad to give you  a    call and talk more about the details of our program. My colleague,    AshleyBaxter, from the Analyst/Associate Program at Enron would join me    as well.       I am sending you a copy of the brochure about the Analyst / Associate    Program.
