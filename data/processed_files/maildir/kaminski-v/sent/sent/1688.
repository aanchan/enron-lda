Thanks Also Vince , you are the Greatest Boss, Have a Wonderful Day !    Kevin G Moore This message is pertaining to the celebration the Weather Team had with Mike Roberts. We celebrated with Mike on Boss's Day Oct. 16th. We the  Weather Team felt that time spent with our Boss was  just as valuable as any token of appreciation. Mike you will not have a token in the staff meeting today  however, please know that you are a great Boss too. We still would like for you to join the others in celebrating and we would like to have lunch with you.                                          Thanks                                      Kevin Moore Hope to see you there !
