Stinson, Let's talk about it at the meeting. Vince Stinson Gibner Shirley, One other possibility for the class.   If we can find/borrow enough lap tops  for everyone to use, we can just get any conference room and use laptops to  take the class.     Many members of the group already have one (me,  Martin,  Tom Halliburton).    Can we find 10 more? --Stinson
