Julie, Yes,  this is how we split this expense internally. Please, send it to me. Vince Vince, ? Oh.? I sent an invoice to Habiba for AUS 5K a while back, and she  informed  me that she passed it along to the people who are handling the  agreement now  (I take that as Fiona Grant in London?).? I will then send  out another  invoice of AUS 5K in the next week or so for the remaining  balance.? Should  I have sent the invoice to you? ? Thanks, Julie cc: Vince, Thank you for your email. We  will send you a copy of the book as soon as it is available, which we are  now estimating to be around 21 November (no need to send us a cheque; you  deserve it). Just let us know if we should use a different address than  your office? in Houston. Thanks again for all of your  help. Julie Julie, As the book is about to be released to  the? market, I would like to start the process to issue the check  to Lacima.? Who will be the payee (Lacima) and what is the?  address? Vince
