I am forwarding the resume of Wendell Licon who works for Enron in the HR department (executive compensation). He used to be an FX trader. I am thinking about moving him to research when his current boss is ready to release him. I think, however, that you should take a look at him as well and see if he fits your needs. Vince Vince, Per your request, I've attached a copy of my resume.  Please let me know if  you have any questions. Regards, Wendell
