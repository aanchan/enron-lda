Beth, Yes. I would appreciate it. Vince     	 	 	 Vince -  The only one I can find is the Dhabol one.  Do you still want that one  alone?  I'm sorry we don't have the others. Beth Vince J Kaminski Beth, Thanks.  Dhabol is one. There should be 2 more case studies we used. One about old EGS, the 2nd about TVA options. 2-3 copies will be sufficient. Vince     	 	 	 Try this...     	 	 	 Vince -  I just found some copies!  How many do you need and I will have them  delivered to you. They are the case about the Dabhol project in India.  Is that the one you  were thinking of? Beth Vince J Kaminski Beth, I have a favor to ask. Do we have copies of Harvard Business School case studies about Enron? We use these case studies during Super Saturdays. I need a few copies. This is for Prof. John Martin. Vince
