Dale, Confirmed. Vince Vince: 7am at Hyatt Regency Downtown would be perfect. I will see you in the lobby at 7am. Best regards, Dale cc: Vince: Can we get together Friday morning July 7 at 800 am at your office?  That would be particularly convenient for me.  I will have to leave downtown at about 945 to catch a plane.  That will ensure that I wont take up too much of your time!!  Thanks for your efforts here, and thanks for being patient with me.
