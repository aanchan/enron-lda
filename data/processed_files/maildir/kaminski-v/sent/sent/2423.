Shirley, Let's act on it. Vince Zimin Lu Vince, We had phone interview with Rabi De.  My impression is good. We should invite  him for a formal interview. He is a hands on person with wide range of experience ( energy financing,  derivatives trading, hedging, etc). He communicates very well and expressed interest in financial engineering &  modeling.
