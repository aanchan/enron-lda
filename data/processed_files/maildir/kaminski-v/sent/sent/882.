Molly, Thanks for the update. Two points. Please, let Neil McGregor know that many possible proposals were floated with regard to Anshuman and there was some noise in the system. We need L1 visa anyway and we decided to go ahead an arrange it. I shall also write to him and explain the confusion. Also, if I have the choice between upsetting Neil or Jeffs (Shankman and  Skilling), I shall choose Neil. Vince     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Vince:  Apparently Neil McGregor became upset when he received Margaret  Daffin's email.    He is saying, however, that Anshuman will only be in  Houston for one month, and you had mentioned six months when we spoke  earlier.   It really doesn't make any difference since he will need to get an  L1 visa under either circumstance, but I thought you might want to see his  email. Molly Margaret Daffin Molly:  per our conversation today.  Please let me know the status so that I  can proceed with the visa process. Thanks Margaret Anshuman is not moving or immigrating to the US. We are allowing him to work  for a 1month assignment in the US with Enron. Please carry out the necessary  approvals and visa's on this basis.
