Shirley, Yes, It will be  a swap of one machine for another. Vince Shirley Crenshaw Vince: Is this ok to order? Mark- flat-screen monitor for me. Clayton Mark Davidson Clayton- Sorry it took so long to get back to you.  There are a couple of things to  keep in mind:  -Enron IT supports Enron equipment.  -All equipment must be purchased through "Enron IT Purchasing" Our current high end desktop is a 800 MHZ pentium III machine with 128M of  1GHz processors come out (in the very near future) that will become our  standard. What we want to avoid is getting equipment that we do not have a image for.   The "image" is the complete package of software that we put on a machine when  it is deployed.  If you go out and buy a machine that we do not have a image  for, we can't support it for a multitude of reasons.  Hopefully this answered your questions/concerns. If not, please call me so that we can discuss this further. Thanks Mark Davidson x 39038 Clayton Vernon Mark- I have developed a model for Enron that requires ultra-high-end PC  performance (it does many calculations in Excel), and my boss has authorized  me to buy whatever PC I need. I'm looking at the Compaq 850, but Richard (our  floor rep) says no PC's over the 600 series will be supported by IT. I need  to resolve this issue; we are sophisticated buyers, we know the type of  machine we want, and we have the money to pay for it. Sincerely, Clayton Vernon Manager, Research
