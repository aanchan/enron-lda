Initially, we will be making markets in bankruptcy protection on reference credits which are currently in our  portfolio but we expect to add additional credit products and reference credits very quickly. The team will utilise EnronOnline as its primary trade execution tool, looking to quickly build market share by capturing the eyes of our current  counterparts. Simultaneously,  we will launch an external web site focused on credit protection where potential customers will have access to real time prices and filter on specific reference credits as well as, access to credit models and research papers on effective credit risk management.  Utilising e-commerce business principles, we expect to aggressively claim the space for corporate credit protection.  We expect to make a public announcement about these new products in late January. In order to effectively access the global market for credit protection, the group will be based in London with an initial local desk set up in Houston as well.  Bryan Seyfried will be transitioning out of RAC, where he was  responsible for the Trading Controls and Research teams in Europe, to lead the group and  he will report to me.  - pic31547.pcx  - pic16788.pcx
