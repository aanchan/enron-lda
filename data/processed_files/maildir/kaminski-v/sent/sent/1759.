Sherri, Thanks for trying. I shall recommend to UT that they should invite Greg Whalley or Lou Pai. Vince     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Vince, Jeff has decided to decline this speaking opportunity.  He is  scheduled to speak at a Leadership conference at UT on 2/16, so given his  time limitations, he wants to pass on this one.  Sorry to be the messenger of  bad news.  SRS Sherri, Any resolution of the scheduling conflict Jeff Skilling had for February the  22nd? Our friends at UT are ready to make the reservations and send out invitations to this conference Vince Rick / Vince: Good morning. Further to my discussions with Vince during his visit to the Energy Finance Program yesterday, I write at this time to inquire whether Mr. Skilling's assistant has been able to confirm his participation as 2/22/2001 keynote speaker at our Conference. With thanks for your intercession on our behalf, Ehud Ronn ==============================================      Ehud I. Ronn      Professor of Finance and Jack S.
