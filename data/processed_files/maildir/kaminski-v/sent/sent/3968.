Steve, The Journal of Risk is a more technical and serious publication than RISK MAgazine. If the article is published it will give you more exposure in  the academic circles.  I think it will be a significant accomplishment. On the downside, it does not receive the same wide circulation as RISK among the practitioners. I can also see the reason behind the recommendation given by Navroz: the article is fairly long for RISK. Steven Leppard Vince Any thoughts on this proposal? Steve     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 Steven, After further consultation with the Technical  Editor, we feel that your work  would find a more suitable environment for  exposure in The Journal of Risk. ? If you email a copy of your work (to the  Editor-in-Chief, Philippe Jorion)  ? ? then I am sure that they will be keen to give due  consideration. ? Thank you for your interest and sorry for the delay in coming  to this  decision. ? Best Wishes, ? Navroz Patel, Technical Assistant, Risk Magazine. ?
