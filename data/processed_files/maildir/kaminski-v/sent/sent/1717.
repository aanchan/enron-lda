Molly, It's OK (even if the answer is ex post). Vince     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Vince:   Would this be okay with you? Molly     	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 	 Dear Molly, I asked about change of the departure city.  They said I should send my ticket back to get a new ticket. Since Aquila provides the ticket, it's hard for me to change the departing place. If possible, can I ask you to arrange the one way flight from Houston to Seattle on the evening of 25th?  I'm sorry for this. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Jaesoo Lew
