FYI Vince Vince Apparently the recruiter spoke to one of my son's  roommates and left a phone  number (713) 343-3214 which he tried several times  and got busy signals.  Today she called just before you called me and left her  cellphone number but  he was in classes all morning and got the message in the  afternoon. I really  appreciate your going out of your?way to help. Perhaps  there will be another  opportunity.? Shmuel?
