I encourage everybody very strongly to join other Enron employees at this  event. It's a great opportunity to contribute to the growth of our city and to make sure that Enron is not  embarrassed  if other energy companies show  up in strength. Vince Enron is hosting a special event on Saturday, March 31st.  The first annual  Enron "Trash Bash" to clean up the banks of Buffalo Bayou between Shepherd  Drive and Sam Houston Park.  I am chairing the Check-In Team which consists of: Registering all of the Volunteers Handing out Enron T-Shirts and Caps Passing out Gloves and Garbage Bags Making Clean Up Section Assignments For anyone who might be interested in helping me, please call me at ext.  30329. Also, we need a lot of volunteers to walk along Buffalo Bayou and pick up  trash.  This would be a great family project, a good project for your childs  youth group or boy scout or girl scout troop.  It will also be fun.  They  will have live bands, lyou get an Enron T-shirt and Enron Baseball Cap, lunch  will be served at Sam Houston Park and there are a lot of good door prizes.    If you want to volunteer for the "Trash Bash" clean up, just show up at Sam  prizes will be drawn and then you can go home feeling like you have done your  part for Houston's Waterway Environment. I hope you will think about it and bring your friends, family, ect. and help  Enron clean up the Environment. Thanks, Anita
