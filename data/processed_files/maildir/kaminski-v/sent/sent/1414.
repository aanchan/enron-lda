Norma FYI Vince Maureen, I apologize that your phone was disconnected in error.  At this time your  phone is working and your Voice Mail box needs to be set up.  I would like to  add however, I do not appreciate your disrespect and unreasonable demands  placed on my employees.  They were not the cause of this problem and can only  relay your information to the appropriate group.  Enron has values of Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.  I  would appreciate you taking the time to review them.   Robert Knight Director Voice Communications  Stella L Ely Please reinstate Maureen's extension immediately, if possible.  It was  disconnected this past weekend when we had it taken off of the phone at EB  3073F.  Her extension was on two phones at two different locations and should  not have been disconnected at EB 1939.  Her extension no. is 30396.  Sorry  for the confusion.  Please let me know timing asap.   Thank you. Stella Ely
