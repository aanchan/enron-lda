Shirley, Please, remind me about making arrangements for this trip later this week. Vince Vince:  My schedule indicates that should be a good day to be on campus, so let's plan for it. Please forward to me those brief topic write-ups you promised so that I can schedule appropriate faculty to meet with you. Thanks.
