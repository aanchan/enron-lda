Linda, FYI Vince     	Enron North America Corp. 	 	 Vince: According to Alex,  Li Xiao gave your email address to Alex.  Did Li Xiao  talk to you first about Alex? I don't know for certain.  Alex contacted you  in March, interviewed once, but nothing came of it.  After Gary left, Li Xiao  suggested to Alex that he try again, and the rest is history.  Grant. Vince J Kaminski Grant,  Did Li Xiao refer Alex  to us? Vince Linda Vargo Can you advise as to whether or not Li Xiao referred Alex to you last  summer.  I need to know this in order to process an employee referral (under old plan) for her. Hi, Linda, I wonder if you heard from Vince Kaminski regarding my referral for Alex  Huang. Thanks,  Li x39635 I am waiting for feedback from Vince Kaminsky.  As soon as I know something,  I will advise.
