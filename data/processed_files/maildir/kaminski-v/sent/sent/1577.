My home phone number is 254-757-0852 if you would like to talk Tuesday evening.  However, I'm in Austin all day and into the evening on Wednesday and off to New Orleans early thursday morning.  How about I call you Thursday afternoon from New Orleans? John p.s. I just got a case study written by some guys at Darden (U. of Va.) on Enron that I am copying and shipping off to you.  they have done all the "heavy lifting" for details so all we need do is determine our focus and write up our paper. John, Another thought. Hoe can I contact you during the week to discuss the presentations? Vince cc: Vince, A couple of things.  First, I'm planning on your arrival at Baylor sometime the afternoon of Monday, November 13.  I want to set up a small seminar for our faculty if you want to do it.  I will schedule it for 4 pm so if you can arrive in Waco (Continental has several flights in each day) sometime in early afternoon I'll pick you up.  The Ex MBA class begins at 6 p.m. and I'll set you up to speak first for about an hour with q&a to follow.  How about putting together some thoughts related to our paper?  You can do the same talk for the faculty in the early afternoon.  You and I can get then together on Tuesday morning to work on the paper.  I have a 1 p.m. class on Tuesday is my only constraint.  If you have time to hang around we'll do the talk a third time in that class.  By then I suspect we will have made some real progress. Next point, we have both Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling set up for Dec 4th in the afternoon.  I plan to get some questions together for them based on our discussions next Monday and Tuesday. I'm really looking forward to seeing you next week and to working on our paper. Have a great week.  I'm off to Austin and New Orleans this week, thus the reason for the early message on the class a week from tomorrow. Take care. John p.s. Take a look at my web site for a review of the spring "new economy and business education conference".  By the by, I need a short bio-sketch on you for the site and for my introduction to the faculty and the class. John D. Martin Carr P.
