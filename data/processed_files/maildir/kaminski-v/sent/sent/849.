Vasant Shanbhogue FYI. Ben Parsons Everyone should read the attached Risk article about calculating def probs  from CDS quotes.  Amazingly it is in pretty close agreement with our own methodology for both  CDS valuation and reverse engineering def probs. The only extension in the  reverse engineering is that instead of linearly interpolating CDS quotes,  they propose minimising an error measure based on 'smoothness' of def prob  curve and difference between model and market prices.  What is also amazing is the fact that this article has been published in  Risk, given that it is essentially the same as my credit pricing paper, plus  one excellent idea. Given extra time, resources and brainpower, there is no  reason why we shouldn't have similar work published ourselves.
