Thanx for visiting my web site! Let me know if there is any progress on your front. Also, I know we talked about several dates around early november, up to now it seems like the 9th would be a candidate... If you could choose one (a friday if you can) I would make all the necessary arrangement. A lot of people here are very anxious to meet you... your reputation precedes you! If you could be free for a diner on the evening preceeding the presentations, or on the day of the presentation I could set up a time table. Sincerely, Pierre-Philippe Ste-Marie pstemarie.homestead.com cc:  Dear Mr. Kaminsky,  Just checking if there was any progress... or  anything I could do to help  you.  Sincerely,  Pierre-Philippe  Ste-Marie  pstemarie.homestead.com
