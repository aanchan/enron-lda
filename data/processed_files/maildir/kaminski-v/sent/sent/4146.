Margaret, Thanks Vince Good  stuff  here..Margaret Joe Hillings Dear Friends of the Institute for Energy Economics and Policy The attached power point presentation "Oil and Gas Markets: Myth and Reality" was given today to a major luncheon (April 18th)  meeting of the American Association for Petroleum Geology Annual Conference in New Orleans.  The presentation looks at current oil and gas markets during the last year and the next twelve months. IEEP makes occasional papers, research, and analysis available to the friends and supporters.  This work asks the question of whether current prices are sustainable and examines the impact of weather and non market factors on the market.  If you would like to know more about our efforts to develop EWxAS, our analytical and risk managment product, please contact us. I thought you might find the attached presentation interesting and perhaqps useful.
