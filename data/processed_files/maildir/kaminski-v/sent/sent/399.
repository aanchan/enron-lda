Shirley, FYI Vince Vince, It was good seeing you again today.  I want to make sure the NFCF is on your calendar for May 4-5.   You should be receiving some registration materials shortly. Please plan on coming if you can. Also, please attend the dinner on Friday evening along with your wife if possible.
