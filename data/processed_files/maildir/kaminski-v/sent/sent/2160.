Marge, The person at Rice to work with is Barbara Ostdiek. Her E-mail address is below (on one of the messages appended at the bottom). Vince MARGE  NADASKY         Vince, would it be possible for me to work with whomever is designing this  mug to see if we could incorporate the Enron logo into the design?  I agree  with Mark that it would be preferable to have the logo somewhere on this.   Please let me know. Marge, Ext. 36631 looks a little off-brand to me.  do you think we need an Enron logo?  can you  help Vince?  anything from the catalog they could personalize? Mark Mark, Rice Univ.  wants to produce a coffee mug for the participants of the workshop Enron sponsors. Please , take a look at the proposed design. Do we need any formal approval? Vince Vince: I have attached the general design we are proposing for the Enron Seminar Series mug.  We have a little refinement to do - spacing here and there a couple type-o's but this is the idea.  If you like it, we will put an order  in. I'll put out an announcement on the seminar schedule shortly.  So far the fall line up includes Will Goetzman - Yale, Lenard Mirman - Virgina, Jeff Pontiff - U. of Washington, George Allyannis - Darden, and Charles Lee - Cornell. Thank you. bbo  - mUG11.pdf
