Kevin, I would greatly appreciate if you could help me in this case. Yaron's father  helped me  a lot to open many doors at Berkeley. Vince Vince, Kevin Hannon is the executive lead for Cornell and he needs to approve.   I  am not sure if they have already interviewed on campus.  He should go through  the on-campus screening process before attending a Super Saturday.  We are  reserving the Super Saturday weekend for individuals that are highly likely  to receive an offer.  I will forward this to Kevin and Kristin Gandy.   Although they are responsible for Graduate recruiting at Cornell, perhaps it  is possible for him to interview when they go on campus. Charlene Kevin and Kristin, Please see Vince's message below. Would it be possible for an undergraduate  to interview while you are at Cornell?  Please let me know.   Thanks Charlene, Please, help. This is a son of a professor at Berkeley who helps me a lot in  the recruiting process. His son goes to Cornell. Can we invite him (the son, not the professor) to a  Super Saturday? I really want to repay the debt to his father who is very instrumental in  my recruiting  efforts. Vince ?  - Yaron-RESUME3.doc
