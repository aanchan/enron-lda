Shirley, Can you, please, call him and ask what would be best timing. The last week of July would be best. I would like Grant, Alex, Zimin, Krishna  and Stinson to meet him. Vince Hi Vince, How are you.  It was really a pleasure meeting you and talking to you at the Toronto energy derivative conference.  Thank you for speaking with me about the possibility of visiting your research group.  It will be great if I could have such opportunity whenever you see your schedule fits.  I am very much open for the last week of July and early August. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. Best, Shijie Shi-Jie Deng Assistant Professor School of ISyE Georgia Institute of Technology Office Phone: (404) 894-6519 Home page:    http://www.isye.gatech.edu/~deng
