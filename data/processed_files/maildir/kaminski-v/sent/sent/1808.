Carol, Thanks. Vince 	Carol Coats 	    You are right, Vince....Celeste and I did discuss it, and she approved his  Feb. start date. Datren does know about that, so it sounds like it is cleared up. Thanks so much, and we are sorry for the confusion! Carol Vince J Kaminski    Stinson, I think it's a mistake. It  should be February. Vince Stinson Gibner FYI 	Carol Coats 	 Celeste,  I just received Datren Williams' acceptance with the following note attached: "My graduation date (Ph.D. Candidate from LSU) is Dec. 2000.  Celeste Roberts has informed me that I would have the option of starting work Feb. 2001.  I am under the impression that I will start in Feb. 2001.  My offer letter has a  start date  of Aug. 2001.  If this is a problem, please give me a call.   Looking forward to working at Enron. Thanks a million, Datren W." Please let me know if he may in fact start in Feb. 2001, and if so, do you  have a specific date for him, or may he choose? Thanks, Celeste, Carol
