Stephanie: This is okay with me. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 		  Carol, See attached from Maclaren re: process agent. 		  Hi Stephanie, Maclaren doesn't have an entity which can act as a process agent in the US. How about this as a suggestion: "(c) Process Agent.  For the purpose of section 13(c) of this Agreement: Process Agent for Party A shall be its legal officer at its address for notices or, in his or her absence, any other senior officer of Party A at such address. Process Agent for Party B shall be its legal officer at its address for notices or, in his or her absence, any other senior officer of Party B at such address. For purposes of this Part 4(b), a "senior officer" shall be any officer of such party with a title of vice president or higher." Regards, Michael cc: Master                                      I have asked Maclaren for one in NY, and will get back to you.  Do you have a Process Agent in Quebec, as it doesn't help Maclaren that yours is in Washington? As I understand it, there are no outstanding issues - the credit issues have been resolved (I guess you have received this update since you are preparing the final drafts).  Once we clear the Process Agent point, the documents can be executed. Regards, Michael Mike, Can you supply me with the Process Agent information for Maclaren?  We are preparing a final draft of the ISDA Master Agreement.
