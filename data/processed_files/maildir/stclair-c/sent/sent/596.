Sara and Jason: Shari's response to the message that I sent to you. Carol 	Shari Stack 		 I don't see a problem with this since the language is standard in most of our  confirms. One thing though - did the revised  Fallback Reference Weather  Station language get finalized? I was working with Dave Kistler on this and  have not heard anything from him on this in over a month. You might check w/  him or Mark Tawney to make sure that we include the most recent wording.  One last query - how is the Confirm Desk going to know whether we have  included the language as part of the ISDA Master?  They also need to keep in  mind that with some CP's, such as American Re - we have agreed special  wording with them and so will have to continue using the longer version of  confirmation.  S   	Carol St Clair 		  Shari: The confirms desk has asked us to think about a way that we could shorten the  confirms that are sent out under Master Agreements by amending each Master to  include definitions/provisions that are common to all confirms.  Below is  what I have come up with.  Do you see any problems with this? Carol 	Carol St Clair 		  Sara and Jason: Here are my initial thoughts on how we can possibly shorten the weather  confirms that are done under a Master Agreement.  It seems like we could  amend the Masters to include the following definitions which seem to be used  in each conform: Payment Date NCDC NWS HDD CDD The Fallback Reference Weather Station procedures - the confirm would  identify just the Fallback Reference Weather Station Data Sources Let me know what you think. Carol Alos, is it necessary to specify bank account information if that is already  set forth in the Master?
