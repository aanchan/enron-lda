Sara: Whoever inherits the Deutsche Bank file from me needs to look at this latest  draft.  I will indicate this on the updated memo that I send around shortly. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 		  Hi Carol: Enclosed is latest draft.  Please note that I changed DB's Threshold at A+ to bring it into line with Enron's rating.  I also added a sweep-in clause to deal with the BT Transactions (Section 18).  Please let me know if those provisions are acceptable.  Subject to internal DB approvals, I think the other substantive points still open are (i) a Moody's rating for the MAC clause, (ii) the demand section in the Guaranty, and (iii) determining the L/C provisions and mechanics.  Please let me know who your replacement on this matter will be and, if we don't speak before you leave, good luck and congratulations.
