Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 		  Did you ever get our Guaranty?  cc:  Final Draft 6-23                       06/26/2000   Carol,   Enclosed is our adjusted guaranty that we had previously altered to  meet   your requirements (sorry I didn't send this initially). Please see  if this   is good for you.   John   PS:  Where is "receipt" you discussed below?  Page 1 of which  document?    <<Enron Guarantee Format - 5-23.doc  Final    Draft 6-23                              06/26/2000                                  Carol -       Enclosed are what I hope will be the final drafts of the Schedule,    Paragraph    13, LC provisions, and Schedule 1.       I have accepted and incorporated the new changes you made plus all  the    changes which we have agreed upon.  I also changed the  presentation of   our    address in Part 4a of the schedule - it's the same information  presented    in    a more concise way.  Finally, I changed the signature block on the    schedule   partner"    -    I don't know where that came from.       Also enclosed is our version of the Guarantee.  Please let me know  if any    other changes are required.  If not, let's proceed with execution  copies   -    let me know if you want to generate them, or if you want me to.
