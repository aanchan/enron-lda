Sara and Mary: Can someone contact Tanya about this? Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 		  I would reccommend sending out notice of trigger of Material Adverse Change  and calling for margin.  Can we prepare the notice..Bob Crane is in agreement. Thanks, Tanya Cc: Curry, Ken We have financial exposure of 4.2MM to United States Gypsum company which may  file Ch. 11 due to mounting asbestos claims.  S&P has not taken any action  since Jan when they lowered ratings to BB-/Negative and removed from Credit  Watch.  However, USG announced today that it is considering "strategic  alternatives", one of which is Chapter 11due to increased litigation. I'll  forward the article. Tanya
