Pam: That sounds great!  I would love to see them too. Carol 		  That sounds good. Do you want me to see if Janet Greene and Midge can go? cc: Hi Carol. I'm really thrilled for you. How long do you plan to stay out?      Scott and Andrea are having a baby! So I'll be a grandmother in November. The first draft is on the web--a sonogram.      How about June 5 - 8 any day for lunch?  Pam Pam: How are things with you?  I am doing great and feeling great!  I've got about another 8 weeks to go and I'm looking forward to getting this part over with.  I hope to work until pretty close to the end if my doctor lets me.  Are you free for lunch anytime soon?  I would love to see you and catch up.  E-mail me back with some good dates and hopefully we can get together.  Tell Patti I said hi. Carol
