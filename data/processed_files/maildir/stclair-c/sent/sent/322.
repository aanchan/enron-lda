Mark: Could you please answer Mark's question?  Alos, Jason Peters and I are still  looking at this and we will call you with any further comments that we have. Carol Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 		 	 ATTORNEY CLIENT  PRIVILEGED. The assignment looks fine, but I don't understand the underlying  transaction.  Is EEL transferring this domain name "WEATHER-DESK.COM" without  any consideration other than using RMS' software program for six months? Before executing this agreement, you need to secure Mark Palmer's permission  since the agreement states that no variation of the name may be used.  He is  the vice president of advertising at Enron Corp.  I have copied him on this. Mark: Could you please take a quick look at this too and let me know if  you have  any comments?  I'm at 33989.  Thanks. Carol Mark Tawney Could you please review this agreement.  Please call if you need some  background information.     	 	 	 Mark Not sure of your exact email address but hopefully one of these is correct. Can you please confirm that you receive this? Below is the agreement our attorneys have drafted for the transfer of the www.weather-desk.com domain name.  Note that they have recommended that a few of the more specific details regarding the corresponding Enron usage of the RMS weather model be addressed in a simple but separate license agreement.   As discussed, in addition to general confidentialiy provisions, those terms will include (1) the access will not cover any international weather data that may be added to the system during the term of use through December 31, as our costs associated with such data are uncertain and (2) the use of the model will be for Enron internal purposes only with no data or analysis results to be shared with third parties. I would appreciate if you can forward this to your legal dept. to review so that we can hopefully get this resolved quickly.
