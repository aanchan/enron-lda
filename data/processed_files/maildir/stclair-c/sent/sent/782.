Harry: Clement is fine with this form Carol 	Harry M Collins 		  Enclosed is Alan's response to the draft. Do you know if Enron Corp is prepared to execute a similiar guarantee? I believe that the introductory sections on liquids could be expanded to  include, SO2 and NOx and other emission credit trading, coal, bandwidth and  pulp, paper and other wood products trading. 	Alan Aronowitz 		 I think this is a very good idea. I assume that Corp. will be willing to sign  a reciprocal form of this Guaranty. Yes, I believe coal, emissions, bandwidth and pulp & paper (?) should be  added to the form in the "Transactions" paragraph as bracketed language that  could be used as appropriate. Harry, I assume you will handle developing the  language and submitting to Carol.  Do you know if Corp. has signed off on the form yet? Alan 	Harry M Collins 		  Please find attached for your review and approval a new multi-commodity  guaranty, which has been developed by Carol St. Clair. This new form would be  used for power, gas and liquids transactions. I believe that it could also be used for emissions and coal transactions Jeff has already signed off on this new format. 	Carol St Clair 		  Jeff, Stacy and Harry:  We have developed a form of multi-product counterparty Guaranty that is a  little different from our old form of counterparty Guaranty.  The main  difference is the deletion of the 15 day cure period in Section 2.  Can you  please take a look at this and let me know if you are okay with this as  something credit can send to counterparties? Thanks. carol
