Mary: I'm waiting for Dave Forester to okay this but I have spoken with Matt  Goering here a few times about this and I believe he has been in contact with  Pruett.  I will give Pruett a call and let him know where things stand but  until I hear from Dave, I can't do anything. carol 	Mary Griff Gray 		  Carol -- In talking to this customer, he said that he has not heard from anyone at  Enron regarding this question.  Could you update me on this request? Thanks, Griff x3-5753     	 	 	                            	 Carol -- John Puett, Duke Energy Corporation, wonders if Duke Energy can discontinue  contract as stated in 6.a, which states that EnronOnline can terminate  contract.
