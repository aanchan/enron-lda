Just a suggestion--I have found it very helpful to have "read" access of  Calendars for all of Mark's direct reports-for availibility purposes.  Let me  know if you want me to have METaylor to edit his Calendar Profile. Taffy  :) 	Janette Elbertson 		  Taffy:   I have scheduled this for 2:00 p.m. on Wednesday, December 20th.

I'm happy to come to the office to meet with them.  Next week, the only day  that is not good is next Tuesday.  I think that we need about 1 hour.  Could  you please check with Mark Taylor's secretary and then let me know what works  best for Mark H. and Mark T.? Thanks. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)
