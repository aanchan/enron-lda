Sara: What do you think? Carol 	Deepak Sitlani 		  Carol Further to my voice-mail message, please see below.  Can you please let me  know whether you are happy for us (in London) to carry out the ISDA  negotiations with respect to Anglo American Corporation? Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. Many thanks Deepak Edmund Cooper 06/06/2000 14:09 Add the first one to the ISDA status list. For the S. Africa entity ENA legal needs to be informed of this as they  usually deal with S. Africa. Suggest you contact Carol St. Clair as to  whether she is happy for us to run with this if we are just going to be doing  deals from Europe. Thanks, Edmund Deepak Sitlani FYI Martin Holmes 06/06/2000 14:00 Paul We would like to begin to establish ISDA agreements with the following  entities: Anglo American plc (www.angloamerican.co.uk) based in London and Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited. The annual financial statement  of Anglo American plc can be taken from the  website above. I have asked the folks at Anglo American in Johannesburg,  South Africa for the financials for the Anglo American Corporation. Can you take a look at this for me please? Thanks Martin
