Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 		 Carol, Attached are the S. 420 and HR 333 as passed, respectively, by the Senate and  the House.  As you know, the bills are prepared to go to conference, however  Senate leadership has not yet figured out how they will organize the  conference. The language of interest to you is located in Title IX, Sec. 901(d), found on  page 292 of HR 333 and on page 307 of S. 420. Thanks, Larry Chris Long Will you please forward S. 420 and H.R. 333 to Carol via e-mail. 		 Chris: Thanks.  I'm checking with Vicki Sharp to see if we want to do anything.   Where can  locate the latest version of the bill that would have the proposed  changes to the forward contract definition? Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 		 Carol - While it never too late to suggest a change, given the political  situation I would be hesitant to offer anything more than a "clarification".   While I would not spend a huge amount of time on it, I suggest you examine if  there are any changes. Depending on what happens in the Senate (now that it  is in Democratic hands), the process can be reopened and we could have an  opportunity to offer suggested changes (or it kill the bill all together). 		  Chris: Would it be too late to suggest changes to the definition of "forward  contracts" in the Bankruptcy Code in order to improve our position with  respect to the physical supply contracts that EES enters into?  I am not sure  what chnages we would want, but was wondering if there was any opportunity to  suggest a change.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.
