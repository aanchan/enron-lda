Mark: Who should handle this?  Given my situation, I would prefer not to take this  on and I have talked to Seth about my situation.  Please let me know what you  think.  Would this be something that Lou Stoler would work on with our help? Carol 		  Carol, I'd like to speak with you regarding the following structure proposed  by Sorema, which address the fact that they can't sell/buy derivatives and  can't reinsure any contract governed by NY law.  The credit issue  remains--they propose solving it by means of an assignment clause. Sorema did six deals with us last year using Palladium. Seth x37487 PLease find attached an explanation of the structure we are looking at. Idriss. (See attached file: Weather Derivatives Reinsurance.doc)  - Weather Derivatives Reinsurance.doc
