Lisa: Per my voice mail, here is what I sent Frank.  Stacy Dickson has confirmed  that all of the Physical answers are ok. Carol 	Carol St Clair 		 Frank: I have sent your responses to Stacy Dickson and Jeff Hodge so that they can  verify the physical questions.  With respect to question #3, I would alos  state that until the Master is executed, all of those trades will be governed  by the online GTC.  Also, to the extent that Cargill traded with Enron Canada  on a financial basis, those trades would alos be confirmed under the Master  as it is my understanding taht we do not do separate Masters with the same  counterparty for ENA and ECC.
