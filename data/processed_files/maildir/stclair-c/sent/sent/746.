Suzanne: Marie is included.  Let's see how everyone else responds and hope that we can  choose Mon, Tues or Wed.  I would prefer Mon or Tuesday because I see the  doctor on Wed but let's see what works for everyone else. 	Suzanne Adams 		  		  Am I really included in this lunch?  If so, I will be out Thursday and  Friday, June 29 and 30. Thanks!
