Wendy: Christian will be handling this with Rhonda's assistance as this is an area  that I am not yet familiar on. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 		  Carol, I tried to contract Morgan yesterday but Debbie Hart said she would have to  call me back.  If I don't hear from here by noon, I will give her another  call.  Also, I am assuming that you will be handling adding the product  definitions as indicated below in the amendment.  Let me know if this is not  the case. Wendy To Rhonda, My bad...It looks like MEGA is assigning ALL of its physical power positions  lower section, which should really be part of the "to be assigned" group. To All, Sorry for the confusion, Wendy Cc: Murphy, Melissa Ann; St Clair, Carol; Ngo, Tracy; Yoder, Christian Please find attached a spreadsheet which matches up the MEGA Deals with the  for accuracy and then review the confirms to ensure that all necessary West  Product Definitions are either in the confirm.  If they are not in the  confirm, they need to be identified in the amendment to the Master Agreement  with Morgan. Thanks, Wendy  << File: Deals COB 052801 (to assign to mscg).xls
