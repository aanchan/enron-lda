Harry: FYI.  Is there anyone else that needs to sign off on this before we roll this  form out? Carol 	Jeffrey T Hodge 		  Carol: At long last I have had an opportunity to review the Multi-Purpose Form of  Guaranty you circulated in early June.  I am fine with that form as something  that we can use and that Credit can send to counterparties. As an aside, the attached e-mail indicates that you forwarded something  yesterday.  If so, I did not see that. I join in Leslie's request to be forwarded a copy of the final form of  guarantee.  Should you have any questions or comments, please contact me at  your convenience. Thanks, Jeff 	Leslie Hansen 		  Carol: As we discussed, Elizabeth and I are fine with the Cross-Commodity Guarantee  you circulated yesterday.  (By the way, we are revising our current physical  power guarantee to eliminate the 15-day cure period.)  One question:  Is ENA  the proper notice recipient in Section 7?  We direct notice to Enron Corp. in  our standard form.   After you have received Jeff's (et al.)  feedback, please send me a copy of  the final form of cross-commodity guarantee so that we can include in our  form file for all requests. Thanks, Leslie
