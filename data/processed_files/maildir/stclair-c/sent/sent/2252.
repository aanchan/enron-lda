We don't have a problem with a 3- business day requirement for posting cash collateral nor a 3-business day requirement for " transfer date" interest posting.  We have a question into our counsel (who has been out sick) on whether we need some form of Board approval for posting collateral. Our main concern (and the reason we would like a 10- business day time period) is if we choose to provide credit support with a LOC, we don't have the staffing and bank pre-arrangements to be able to put an LOC in place within a shorter period. Since we don't currently exchange collateral, posting a LOC would not be something we do in the normal course of business. As such, if the need should arise, we would like to have sufficient time to allow staff to look at our alternatives and provide the form collateral that best suits the situation.                      05/15/2001  I made changes to  (h) Sections 8.1 (c) and 8.2 (c) changing the days for  providing Performance Assurance form 3 to 10.
