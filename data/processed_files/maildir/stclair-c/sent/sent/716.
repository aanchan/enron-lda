Lin: Let me take a look at the letter agreement and see what we can do. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 		  Dear Carol,    We do not want to create an agreement specfic coversheet for each counterparty.  Is there some way to put language in the body of the letter agreement to address your concerns.  The procedure we are proposing is intended to supplement current requirements in the ISDA, not replace them.  If you feel that additional definition needs to be added to the confirmation process, shouldn't we put that definition in the letter agreement rather than on the cover sheet? Our goal is to be able to expedite our response to counterparty confirms. In order to do this we need to have the same cover sheet in place for each counterparty.  Please call me at 678-579-3378 so that we may discuss possible solutions.  Thanks, Lin cc: COVERSHEET PROCESS LTR.DOC  <<CONFIRMATION COVERSHEET PROCESS LTR.DOC Carol,  Please feel free to change the letter agreement.  The coversheet needs to remain as it is, because we are using this same sheet for all counterparties.  Thanks, Lin (See attached file: CONFIRMATION COVERSHEET PROCESS LTR.DOC)
