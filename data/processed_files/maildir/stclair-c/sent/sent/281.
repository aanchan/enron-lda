Carol, from the way this sounds, your four weeks goes on into the 26 weeks as  long as your doctor hasn't released you.  What do you think.  Man, this stuff  is hard to decifer! 	Carmen Chavira 		 Under doctors care, the employee is paid 4 wks at 100% of their base, granted  that no sick time has been taken prior to the maternity leave.  If the doctor  requires her to be off work before her due date, this time would be coded as  sick.  Even after delivery and still under doctors care you would code her  sick time.  until the doctor releases her to return to work.  Once she has  been released by the doctor Carol has the option to take time off using any  vacation available or could take FMLA leave (if  she qualifies )  with  supervisor approval.   carmen Suzanne Adams Carmen, I understand that Carol will get her 4 weeks sick pay for having the  baby and then whatever vacation she wants to take, but what does the doctor  need to do to extend her into the 26 weeks of 90% pay.  She's already  starting to have problems, so I'm sure she's not going to be able to return  to work after 4 weeks.  I need details on how to address this issue.  Thanks,  Suzanne
