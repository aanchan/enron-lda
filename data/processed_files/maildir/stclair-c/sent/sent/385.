Russell: Please see the e-mails that Susan and I have exchanged.  Since we are still  confirming deals under ARMS, does the effective date on the Transfer and  Termination Agreement work?  I want to make sure that it covers all trades  that have been confirmed with ARMS until we start confirming with Utilicorp.   Please advise. Carol Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 	Susan Bailey 		 Carol, Not yet.  The master agreement documents were sent out by FED EX on Monday,  May 8th. As for the effective date of the (a) Master Agreement and (b) Transfer and  Termination Agreement, both documents were given an effective date of May 3,  2000. 	Carol St Clair 		  	 Susan: Has this Master been executed?  I forgot what we specified as the effective  date of the Transfer and Assignment Agreement with ARMS but we need to make  absolutely sure that the effective date covers all trades that are done by  ARMS and that there is no gap between that effective date and the effective  date of our Master.  Also, please make sure that Tana knows when the  Utilicorp Master becomes effective so she can notify the online folks.   Thanks. Carol
