Mark: FYI. Carol 	Gaurav Babbar 		  Carol, I spoke with David Forster about the procedures for the auction and the  possibility to include a different GTC.  According to him this should not be  an issue and that we don't need to get Mark Taylor's approval, as this has  already been cleared by him for other transactions.  I am going to meet with  the EOL people again and I will forward you and the team any changes in the  procedures if they arise. Gaurav
